<p>For some of you, <a href="https://blog.zarfhome.com/">Andrew Plotkin</a> will need no introduction. The rest of you ought to know that he&#8217;s quite an amazing guy, easily one of the half-dozen most important figures in the history of post-Infocom interactive fiction. By my best reckoning, he&#8217;s written an even dozen fully realized, polished text adventures in all, from 1995&#8217;s <em>A Change in the Weather</em>, the co-winner of the very first IF Competition, to his 2014 Kickstarter-funded epic <em>Hadean Lands</em>. While he was about it, he made vital technical contributions to interactive fiction as well; perhaps most notably, he invented a new virtual machine called Glulx, which finally allowed games written with the Inform programming language to burst beyond the boundaries of Infocom&#8217;s old Z-Machine, while the accompanying Glk input-output library allowed then to make use of graphics, sound, and modern typography. Over the last ten years or so, Andrew &#8212; or &#8220;Zarf,&#8221; as his friends who know him just a little bit better than I do generally call him &#8212; has moved into more of an organizing role in the interactive-fiction community, taking steps to place it on a firm footing so that its most important institutions can outlive old-timers like him and me.</p>
<p>Andrew was kind enough to sit down with me recently for a wide-ranging conversation that started with his formative years as an Infocom superfan in the 1980s, went on to encompass some of his seminal games and other contributions of the 1990s and beyond, and wound up in the here and now. I hope you&#8217;ll enjoy reading this transcript of our discussion as much as I enjoyed chatting with Andrew screen to screen. He&#8217;s refreshingly honest about the sweet and the bitter of being a digital creator working mostly in niche forms.</p>
<p>One final note before we get started: Andrew is currently available for contract or full-time employment. If you have need of an experienced programmer, systems architect, writer, and/or game designer whose body of work speaks for itself, you can <a href="https://blog.zarfhome.com/about">contact him through his website</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Perhaps we should start with some very general background. Have you lived in the Boston area your whole life?</strong></p>
<p>No, not at all! I only moved to Boston in 2005.</p>
<p>I was born in 1970 in Syracuse, New York, a place that I don&#8217;t remember at all because my family moved to New Jersey when I was about three. We lived there for a couple of years, then my father got a job in the Washington, D.C., area. I went to primary school through high school there.</p>
<p><strong>And when and where did you first encounter interactive fiction?</strong></p>
<p>It must have been around 1979. My father&#8217;s company had a &#8220;bring your family to work&#8221; day. A teletype there was running <a href="/2011/05/will-crowthers-adventure-part-1"><em>Adventure</em></a>. My father plunked me down in front of it and explained what was going on. I thought it was the best thing in the universe. I banged on it for a couple of hours while everybody else was running around the office, although I didn&#8217;t get very far.</p>
<p>For the next few months, Dad was playing it at work, illicitly &#8212; that was how everybody played it. He would bring home these giant sheets of fan-fold printer paper showing his latest progress. As I recall, I suggested the solution to the troll-bridge puzzle: giving the golden eggs to the troll. That was great, the first adventure-game puzzle I solved.</p>
<p><strong>When did you first get a computer at home?</strong></p>
<p>Around 1980, we got an Apple II Plus. We acquired the first three <a href="/tag/scott-adams/?order=asc">Scott Adams</a> games and <a href="/2012/01/selling-zork"><em>Zork</em></a>, which was newly available, plus <a href="/2011/07/microsoft-adventure">Microsoft&#8217;s port of <em>Adventure</em></a> to the Apple II.</p>
<div id="attachment_6210" style="width: 610px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://www.filfre.net/2024/12/a-conversation-with-andrew-plotkin/cake/" rel="attachment wp-att-6210"><img decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-6210" class="wp-image-6210" src="https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/cake-300x206.jpeg" alt="" width="600" height="412" srcset="https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/cake-300x206.jpeg 300w, https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/cake-1024x703.jpeg 1024w, https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/cake-768x527.jpeg 768w, https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/cake.jpeg 1508w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-6210" class="wp-caption-text">Andrew&#8217;s bar mitzvah cake took the form of an Apple II.</p></div>
<p>That started my lifelong attachment to Infocom. I played all the games as they came out. I begged my folks to buy them for me. Later, I spent my own money on them.</p>
<p><strong>You played <em>all</em> of the Infocom games upon their first release?</strong></p>
<p>Pretty much, up until I went off to college. I remember that I did not play <a href="/2015/10/plundered-hearts"><em>Plundered Hearts</em></a> when it came out.</p>
<p><strong>That one was a hard sell for a lot of young men &#8212; although it&#8217;s a brilliant game.</strong></p>
<p>Yeah. I didn&#8217;t play it because I was a seventeen-year-old boy.</p>
<p>I also didn&#8217;t play <a href="/2016/04/zork-zero"><em>Zork Zero</em></a> or the [illustrated] games that came after it because I had gone off to college and didn&#8217;t have the Apple II anymore. But I did catch up with all of them a few years later.</p>
<p><strong>You mention that you did get some adventure games from other companies when you first got the Apple II. Did that continue, or were you exclusively loyal to Infocom?</strong></p>
<p>Well, I was haunting the download BBSes and snarfing any pirated game I could. I played <a href="/2012/03/making-wizardry"><em>Wizardry</em></a> and <a href="/2012/02/ultima-part-1"><em>Ultima</em></a>. I didn&#8217;t play too many other text adventures. I knew they existed &#8212; I had seen ads for <a href="/2012/04/sentient-software">Mike Berlyn&#8217;s pre-Infocom stuff</a> &#8212; but I didn&#8217;t really hunt them down because I knew that Infocom was actually better at it. I remember that we had <a href="/2011/10/the-wizard-and-the-princess-part-1"><em>The Wizard and the Princess</em></a>, which was just clunky and weird and not actually solvable.</p>
<p><strong>I know that you also wrote some of your own text adventures on the Apple II in <a href="/2011/05/in-defense-of-basic">BASIC</a>, as a lot of people were doing at this time.</strong></p>
<p>Yes. The first one I did was a parody of <a href="/2013/04/enchanter"><em>Enchanter</em></a>. I called it <em>Enchanter II</em>. It was a joke game that I could upload to the BBSes: &#8220;Look, it&#8217;s the sequel!&#8221; It was very silly. It started out pretending to be an Infocom game, then started throwing in <em>Doctor Who</em> jokes. The closing line was, &#8220;You may have lost, but we have gained,&#8221; the ending from <a href="/2011/11/the-prisoner-part-1">the Apple II <em>Prisoner</em> game</a>. It was terrible.</p>
<p>But I did write it and release it. Unfortunately, as far as I know it&#8217;s lost. I&#8217;ve never seen it archived anywhere.</p>
<p>I did <a href="https://ifdb.org/viewgame?id=wvs2vmbigm9unlpd"><em>Inhumane</em></a> after that. That was another parody game, but it was meant to have actual puzzles. It was inspired by the <a href="https://www.drivethrurpg.com/en/product/94938/grimtooth-s-traps"><em>Grimtooth&#8217;s Traps</em></a> role-playing books. I liked the idea of people dying in funny ways.</p>
<p><strong><em>Inhumane</em> is obviously juvenilia, but at the same time it shows some of what was to come in your games. There&#8217;s a subversive angle to it: here&#8217;s a game full of traps where the objective is to hit all the traps. That&#8217;s the way I play a lot of games, but inadvertently. Here that&#8217;s the point.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Were you heavily into tabletop RPGs?</strong></p>
<p>No. Tabletop role-playing I was never into. I get performance anxiety when I&#8217;m asked to come up with stories on the fly. I just don&#8217;t enjoy sitting at a table and being in that position. It&#8217;s not my thing.</p>
<p>But I was interested in role-playing scenarios and source books. First, because of the long-term connection to [computer] adventure games, second because they had so much creative world-building and storytelling, just to read. So, yeah. I was interested in tabletop role-playing games but not in actually playing them.</p>
<p><strong>A surprising number of people have told me the same: they never played tabletop RPGs much but they liked the source books. For some people, the imagination that goes into those is enough, it seems.</strong></p>
<p><strong>So, you go off to university. Why did you choose Carnegie Mellon University?<br />
</strong></p>
<p>I got rejected by MIT! It was second on the list.</p>
<p><strong>Were you aware that Infocom was <a href="/2012/01/the-roots-of-infocom">connected so closely</a> to MIT?</strong></p>
<p>No. I knew that they were in Cambridge because I subscribed to the <em>Status Line</em> newsletter. There was a running theme of them mentioning stuff around Cambridge. And I&#8217;d played <a href="/2015/10/mit-and-gue-or-the-annotated-lurking-horror"><em>The Lurking Horror</em></a>. But I didn&#8217;t have the full context of &#8220;these were MIT students who made <a href="/2012/01/zork-on-the-pdp-10"><em>Zork</em> at MIT</a>.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>I guess it would have made the rejection even more painful if you&#8217;d known. </strong></p>
<p><strong>At university, you&#8217;re exposed to Unix and the Mac for the first time.</strong></p>
<p>Yes. And to <a href="/2022/05/a-web-around-the-world-part-10-a-web-of-associations">the Internet</a>. And I started learning &#8220;real&#8221; programming languages like C.</p>
<p><strong>Did you also play games at university?</strong></p>
<p>Yes. I ran into <a href="/2023/07/going-rogue">roguelikes</a> for the first time.</p>
<p><strong>Which ones did you play?</strong></p>
<p>I played a fair bit of <em>Advanced </em><em>Rogue</em>, but I never got good at it. There were people playing <em>NetHack</em>, but it was clear that that was a game where you had to put in a lot of time to make any serious progress. <em>Rogue</em> was a little bit lighter.</p>
<p><strong>Yeah. I never was willing to put in the hours and hours that it takes to get good at those games. Now especially, when I write about so many games, I just don&#8217;t have the time to devote 200 hours to <em>NetHack</em>.</strong></p>
<p><strong>You&#8217;ve since re-implemented one of your own programming experiments from university, <a href="https://ifdb.org/viewgame?id=pnleii72sdlxs2ib"><em>Praser 5</em></a>.</strong></p>
<p>That was not originally a parser-based text adventure. It was a puzzle stuck inside the CMU filesystem. Every &#8220;room&#8221; was a directory, connected by symlinks. You literally CDed into the directory and typed &#8220;ls,&#8221; and the description would pop up in the file listing. Then you would type, &#8220;cd up,&#8221; &#8220;cd left,&#8221; whatever, to follow symlinks to other directories. It was an experiment in using the tools of a shared computer system to make an embedded game. The riddles were a matter of running a small executable which was linked in each directory. I used file permissions to give people access to more things as they solved more puzzles.</p>
<p>Much later, after I had learned Inform 6, I did the parser version.</p>
<p><strong>What did you do right after university?</strong></p>
<p>I graduated in 1992, but I wanted to stick around the Pittsburgh area because a lot of my friends hadn&#8217;t graduated yet. I got a job in the CMU computer-science department and shacked up with a couple of classmates in a rundown apartment.</p>
<p>That was great. I bought my first Macintosh and started writing stuff on it. That&#8217;s when I started working on <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/game/22376/systems-twilight/"><em>System&#8217;s Twilight</em></a>. I figured it was time for me to get into my games career. I decided to write a game and release it as shareware to make actual money. So, I bought a tremendous number of Macintosh programming manuals, which I still have.</p>
<p><em><strong>System&#8217;s Twilight</strong></em><strong> has the fingerprints of <a href="/2015/11/cliff-johnsons-fools-errand">Cliff Johnson</a> of <em>Fool&#8217;s Errand</em> fame all over it.</strong></p>
<p>Yes. It was an homage.</p>
<p><strong>When did you first play his games? Was that at university?</strong></p>
<p>Yeah. Those came out between 1988 and 1992, when I was there. I had a campus job, so I could afford a couple of games. I played them on the campus Macintoshes.</p>
<p>I remember very well being in one of the computer clusters at two in the morning, solving the final meta-puzzle of <em>The Fool&#8217;s Errand</em>. I had written down all of the clues the game had fed me on papers that were spread out all over the desk. Every time I used one of the clues, I&#8217;d grab the piece of paper, crumple it up, and throw it over my shoulder. When I finished, the desk was empty and I was surrounded by paper.</p>
<p><strong>We had an amazing experience with <em>The Fool&#8217;s Errand</em> as well. My wife fell in love with it. It was our obsession for two weeks. When I talked to Cliff Johnson years ago, my wife told me to tell him that he was the only man other than me that she could see herself marrying. I wasn&#8217;t sure how to take that.</strong></p>
<p><strong>What were your expectations for <em>System&#8217;s Twilight</em>?</strong></p>
<p>I intended to make some money. I didn&#8217;t know how much would show up or whether it would lead to more things. It was just something I could do that would be a lot more fun than the programming I was doing in my day job.</p>
<p><strong>Now that you had your own Macintosh and a steady income, I guess you started buying more commercial games again? I know you have a huge love for <a href="/2020/02/myst-or-the-drawbacks-to-success"><em>Myst</em></a>, which came out around this time.</strong></p>
<p>I was actually a little bit late to <em>Myst</em>. I didn&#8217;t play it until 1994, when everybody was already talking about it.</p>
<p><strong>But when you did, it was love at first sight?</strong></p>
<p>Yeah. The combination of the environment and the soundscape was great and the puzzles were fun. It felt like someone was finally doing the graphical adventure right. I&#8217;d never gotten into the LucasArts and Sierra versions of graphical adventures because they were sort of parodic, and the environments weren&#8217;t actually attractive. They were very pixelated. They just weren&#8217;t trying to be immersive. But <em>Myst</em> was doing it right.</p>
<p><strong>As long as we&#8217;re on the subject: I guess </strong><a href="/2024/05/riven"><em><strong>Riven</strong></em></a><strong> absolutely blew your mind?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, it did. It was vastly larger and more interesting and more cohesively thought-through than <em>Myst</em> had been. I played it obsessively and solved it and was very happy.</p>
<p><strong>At what point did you get involved with the people who would wind up being the founders of a post-Infocom interactive-fiction community?</strong></p>
<p>In 1993 or 1994, someone pointed me to <a href="/2019/10/new-tricks-for-an-old-z-machine-part-1-digging-the-trenches">an open-source Infocom interpreter</a>. I hadn&#8217;t really been aware of the technology stack behind Infocom&#8217;s games. But now you could pull all of the games off of the <a href="/2019/04/an-unlikely-savior"><em>Lost Treasures</em></a> disks and run them on Unix machines. That was kind of interesting.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t remember how I encountered the rec.arts.int-fiction newsgroup. But when I did, people were talking about reverse-engineering the Infocom technology. I wrote an interpreter of my own for [Unix] X Windows that had proportional fonts, command-line editing, command history, scroll bars &#8212; all the stuff we take for granted nowadays. I released that, then ported it to the Macintosh. That was my first major interaction with rec.arts.int-fiction.</p>
<p><strong>It must have been around this time that Kevin Wilson made a very historically significant post on Usenet, announcing the very first IF Competition. You submitted <a href="https://ifdb.org/viewgame?id=00wlim27k5d1hmf2"><em>A Change in the Weather</em></a> and won the Inform category. Did you write that game specifically for the Comp?</strong></p>
<p>Let me back up a little bit. In early 1995, I got an offer from a game company in Washington, D.C, called <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/company/12563/magnet-interactive-studios-inc/">Magnet Interactive</a>, to port games from 3DO to Macintosh. So, I moved to Washington &#8212; I was very sad to leave Pittsburgh behind &#8212; and rented a terrible little rundown apartment there. I was also making some money from <em>System&#8217;s Twilight</em>, and had started working on a sequel, which was to be called <em>Moondials</em>. It was a slog. I had some ideas for puzzles, but the story was just not coming together.</p>
<p>So, when Kevin Wilson said, &#8220;Hey, let&#8217;s do this thing,&#8221; I said, &#8220;I&#8217;m going to take a break from <em>Moondials</em> and write a text adventure very fast.&#8221; The process started with downloading <a href="/2019/11/new-tricks-for-an-old-z-machine-part-3-a-renaissance-is-nigh">Inform 5</a> and the manual and reading it. I think I blasted through the manual five times in a week.</p>
<p>The start of the Competition was a little weird because we didn&#8217;t yet have the idea of all of the games being made available at the same time. Kevin just said, &#8220;Upload your games to the IF Archive.&#8221; So, all of the games trickled in at different times. For the second Comp, we settled very firmly on the idea of all games being released at the same time because the 1995 experience was not very satisfactory.</p>
<p><strong>I know that it&#8217;s always frustrating to be asked where ideas come from. But sometimes it&#8217;s unavoidable, so I&#8217;m going to ask it about <em>A Change in the Weather</em>.</strong></p>
<p>I think I was drawing on the general sense of being an introvert and not making friends easily &#8212; being separated from people and feeling alienated from my social group. My college experience wasn&#8217;t solidly that. I was an introvert, but I was at a computer college, and there were a lot of introverts and introvert-centered social groups. I had friends, had housemates after college, as I said. But I still struggled somewhat with social activities. It was a failure mode I was always aware of, that I might end up on the edge not really talking to people. I drew on that experience in general in creating the scenario of <em>A Change in the Weather</em>.</p>
<p><strong>That&#8217;s interesting. From my outsider perspective, I can see that much more in <a href="https://ifdb.org/viewgame?id=rcrihauxixy48svr"><em>So Far</em></a>, your next game. It really dwells on this theme of alienation and connection, or the lack thereof. That also strikes me as the game of yours that&#8217;s most overtly influenced by <em>Myst</em>. Just from the nature of the environment and the magical-mechanical puzzles. It&#8217;s not deserted like <em>Myst</em>, but you can&#8217;t interact in any meaningful way with the people who are there &#8212; which goes back to this theme of alienation.</strong></p>
<p>I wasn&#8217;t thinking of <em>Myst</em> specifically there, but it was part of my background by that point. The direct emotional line in <em>So Far</em> was breaking up with my college girlfriend. That was a couple of years in the past by this point. That had been in Pittsburgh. A lot of the energy for working on <em>System&#8217;s Twilight</em> came from suddenly being stuck at home after that relationship ended. I channeled my frustrations into programming.</p>
<p>But then I tried to drop it into <em>So Far</em> as a theme of people being separated. None of the specifics of what had happened were relevant to the game &#8212; just the feeling.</p>
<p><strong>By the time of <em>So Far</em>, you were as big as names get in modern interactive fiction. Your next game <a href="https://ifdb.org/viewgame?id=zj3ie12ewi1mrj1t"><em>Lists and Lists </em></a>was arguably not a game at all. What made you decide to write a LISP tutorial as interactive fiction? Do you have a special relationship with LISP?</strong></p>
<p>Yes! I hate it! I had taken functional-programming courses in college and learned LISP. But I just did not jibe with it at all.</p>
<p><strong>That&#8217;s ironic because <a href="/2012/01/zil-and-the-z-machine">Infocom&#8217;s programming language ZIL</a> was heavily based on LISP.</strong></p>
<p>Right. It was an MIT thing, but it was not my thing. Nevertheless, the concept of building it into the Z-Machine with a practical limit of 64 K of RAM &#8212; or really less than that &#8212; seemed doable. And I had written a LISP interpreter as a programming exercise during my first or second year in college. So, I was aware of the basics. Doing it in Inform wasn&#8217;t a gigantic challenge, just a certain amount of work.</p>
<p><strong>Were you already starting to feel restless with the traditional paradigm of interactive fiction? Right after <em>Lists and Lists</em>, you released <a href="https://ifdb.org/viewgame?id=egtt6j8vif0plzrc"><em>The Space Under the Window</em></a>, which might almost work better if it was implemented in hypertext. It&#8217;s almost interactive poetry.</strong></p>
<p>I wasn&#8217;t bored with traditional games, but I did want to try different things and see what could be done. And writing in Inform was simple enough that I could just whip out an idea and see whether it worked. That was inspiring the whole community at this point. That was the lesson of the first IF Comp: you can just sit down and try an idea, and a month later people will be talking about it. There was a very rapid fermentation cycle.</p>
<p><strong>Yes. It led to much more formal experimentation. Before the Comp came along, everybody was trying to <a href="/2021/09/the-neo-classical-interactive-fiction-of-1995">follow the Infocom model</a> and make big games. But if you have an idea that&#8217;s more conceptual or avant garde, it&#8217;s often better suited to a smaller game. The Comp created a space for that. If you do something and submit it to the Comp, even if it&#8217;s highly experimental, it will get played and noticed and discussed.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Now we come to The Big One of your games in many people&#8217;s eyes. And I must admit that this applies to me as well. <a href="https://ifdb.org/viewgame?id=2xyccw3pe0uovfad"><em>Spider and Web</em></a> is such a brilliantly conceived game. I&#8217;m in awe of this game. So, thank you for that.</strong></p>
<p>You&#8217;re welcome. It&#8217;s always tricky to have a game which is so purely built out of a single idea because then, when you try to write another game, you think you have to come up with another idea that&#8217;s as good, and it&#8217;s never possible.</p>
<p><strong>Was this idea born out of any particular experience, perhaps with other media?</strong></p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think it was. I was prying into what we would now call the triangle of identities &#8212; prying into the idea that what the game&#8217;s text is telling you is a point of view that might have biases behind it. There is a dialog between what the player thinks about the world and what the game thinks about the world, and there can be cracks in between. That led to the idea of using the storytelling of the game to tell a lie, and that there is a truth behind it which can be discerned.</p>
<p>I started with that kernel and started coming up with puzzle scenarios. Here is an outcome that is verifiable. But there&#8217;s two different versions of what happened that could have led to that outcome. I&#8217;m going to tell one, but the other is going to be the truth. I strung together a few different versions of that. Then I said, okay, if we&#8217;re lying, then the introduction of the game has to introduce the lie. So I folded that in from the start. I knew that I wanted a two-part structure: you learn what&#8217;s going on, then you make use of all of the information.</p>
<p><strong>The moment of transition between the two is often referred to as simply The Puzzle. It&#8217;s been called the best single text-adventure puzzle ever created. Did you realize how special it was at the time?</strong></p>
<p>No. I figured it would be a puzzle. I didn&#8217;t understand how much of an impact it would have. I knew that I wanted to surprise players by having a possibility suddenly become available. Here&#8217;s a thing that I can do, and I will do it. Any kind of good puzzle solution is a surprise when you think of it. Afterward it seems obvious. I knew I had a good combination of elements to make it work, but I wasn&#8217;t thinking about the way that it would reorient the entire history of the game in the player&#8217;s head in one fell swoop. I don&#8217;t know. Maybe I had an inkling.</p>
<p><strong>What I love is that the game is called <em>Spider and Web</em>. Suddenly when you solve that puzzle, those two categories get reversed. Who is really the spider and who is caught in the web?</strong></p>
<p>The reason I called it <em>Spider and Web</em> was actually the old idiom &#8220;What a tangled web we weave when we practice to deceive.&#8221; The notion of deception was meant to be part of the title, and the spider was there just to go with the web. But yes, it&#8217;s multi-valent.</p>
<p><strong>I know you&#8217;re a big reader of science fiction and fantasy. I wouldn&#8217;t picture you reading a James Bond novel. What made you decide to go in the direction of spy fiction here?</strong></p>
<p>Honestly, I thought of it as science fiction. The spy fiction was merely because the story was about deception, and somebody had to be fooling somebody. But conceptually, I had it pinned as a science-fiction scenario from some kind of dystopian cold war, but with magically advanced technology.</p>
<p><strong>You entered <a href="https://ifdb.org/viewgame?id=mh1a6hizgwjdbeg7"><em>Hunter, in Darkness</em></a> into the 1999 IF Comp. It&#8217;s a riff on <a href="/2011/05/hunt-the-wumpus-part-1"><em>Hunt the Wumpus</em></a>, which is about the most minimalist imaginable text adventure, if you can even call it that. Your game, by contrast, is a lushly atmospheric, viscerally horrifying fiction. Were you just being cheeky?</strong></p>
<p>Yeah, I was. I just wanted to put in all the stuff that <em>Wumpus</em> didn&#8217;t have, without getting away from the core concept. I thought it would be a funny thing to do. I worked really hard on the claustrophobia and the creepy bats. I remember crawling under a chair to try to get the feel of being in a narrow passage and not being able to move around &#8212; just to get the bodily sense of that.</p>
<p><strong>Then we have <a href="https://ifdb.org/viewgame?id=hsfc7fnl40k4a30q"><em>Shade</em></a> from 2000, which is another of my favorites of your games. Even more than <em>Hunter, in Darkness</em>, it has a horror vibe.</strong></p>
<p>Yes. I leaned into it harder in <em>Shade</em>.</p>
<p><strong>There are all kinds of opinions about what is really going on in <em>Shade</em></strong>.<strong> I know you like to let people draw their own conclusions about your games, so I won&#8217;t press you on that&#8230;</strong></p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s a lot of disagreement on the main point, that you&#8217;re dying and this is all a hallucination.</p>
<p><strong>Yeah, that was absolutely my take on it, that you&#8217;re dying of thirst in the desert. I saw it pointed out in a review that everything you&#8217;re trying to do is the opposite of the real problem you have. You&#8217;re trying to get out of your apartment in the hallucination, but your real problem is that you <em>are</em> out, lost in the desert. Was that something you were consciously doing, or are we all reading too much into it?</strong></p>
<p>Well, neither. I don&#8217;t think I was consciously thinking that way, but that doesn&#8217;t mean that you&#8217;re reading stuff into it. It&#8217;s deliberately ambiguous. I had a lot of images in my head that I threw out at random. I did have the notion that this environment in your apartment was from your past. You really had packed up your apartment and called a taxi and gotten out, and reiterating it was&#8230; inappropriate but real. It was in your head while you were having this terrible experience, and it was being replayed by your brain in a broken way. You&#8217;re in a place of blinding light &#8212; it&#8217;s very hot &#8212; and the experience you&#8217;re replaying is very dim and dark, except that when light occurs it&#8217;s painful.</p>

<p><strong>Although your games of the 1990s are fondly remembered and still played, you were also making major technical contributions. Probably most important was the <a href="https://www.eblong.com/zarf/glulx/">Glulx</a> &#8212; sorry, I can&#8217;t say that word! &#8212; virtual machine to let Inform games expand beyond the strictures of Infocom&#8217;s old Z-Machine. How did that come about?</strong></p>
<p>No one knows how to pronounce it!</p>
<p>I started to think about it in probably 1996, when <a href="/2019/11/new-tricks-for-an-old-z-machine-part-2-hacking-deeper-or-follies-of-graham-nelsons-youth">Graham [Nelson]</a> came out with version 7 and 8 of the Z-Machine. Version 8 was big &#8212; big enough for Graham&#8217;s <a href="https://ifdb.org/viewgame?id=28uhmejlntcbccqm"><em>Jigsaw</em></a> &#8212; but it was still just a stopgap. It was only twice as big as Infocom&#8217;s version 5. There were all kinds of things that didn&#8217;t scale. It seemed worthwhile to make a fresh design that would be 32-bit from the start. I just didn&#8217;t want to deal with more incremental changes. And being able to jettison all of the weird legacy stuff about the Z-Machine seemed like a win too &#8212; being able to rethink all of these decisions in a technological context that is not 1979.</p>
<p>One of the things I wanted to do was to separate out the input-output layer. I had already written Z-Machine interpreters for X Windows and Mac that used <a href="https://ifarchive.org/indexes/if-archive/infocom/interpreters/zip/">Mark Howell&#8217;s ZIP engine</a> with different interface front-ends. When TADS went open-source around 1997, I made an interpreter for that. So, now I had this matrix, right? I&#8217;ve got an X Windows front-end and a Mac front-end, and they both slap onto the Z-Machine and the TADS virtual machine. In a pretty clear way, these things are just plug and play. All the virtual machine does is accept text input and generate text output. I mean, yes, there&#8217;s the status line, maybe sound and graphics, but fundamentally that&#8217;s what it&#8217;s doing. And the front-end presents that text in a way that suits the platform on which it&#8217;s running. I was doing the same thing that Infocom did, just slicing it into more layers. Infocom had an interpreter and a game file. I said, we&#8217;re going to have an interpreter engine and an interpreter front-end. Thus there will be more flexibility.</p>
<p>I designed the front-end first, <a href="https://www.eblong.com/zarf/glk/Glk-Spec-075.html">the Glk library</a>. I made an implementation for Mac and for X Windows and for the Unix command line. Then I started thinking about the virtual machine. I ripped apart the Inform 6 compiler so it could compile to Glulx from the same game source code.</p>
<p><strong>As I recall, the Glulx virtual machine is bigger than the Z-Machine &#8212; for all practical purposes, its capacity is infinite &#8212; but also simpler. There&#8217;s less of the hard-coded stuff that Infocom included, like the object tables.</strong></p>
<p>Yes, exactly. I figured the more generic and simple I could make it, the better. It would be simpler to design and simpler to implement. It adds complexity to the compiler, but the compiler already needs code to generate object tables in a specific format. It would still be doing that, but there wouldn&#8217;t be any hardware support for them. I&#8217;d just have to include veneer routines to handle object tables in this format. Then, if we ever need to change the format, no problem. We just change the compiler. We don&#8217;t need to change the virtual machine.</p>
<p><strong>When did you publish the Glulx specification?</strong></p>
<p>April 1, 1999.</p>
<p><strong>Were you still living in Washington, D.C., at this time?</strong></p>
<p>I had moved around a lot, actually. The job in D.C. only lasted about a year and a half. After the porting project I had been doing finished up, the company dropped me onto a project to do a <em>Highlander</em> licensed game, which we had absolutely no concept of how to do. This would have been like a 3D action game. That project got canned.</p>
<p>Then I worked for a document company in Maryland for a while. Then I moved back to Pittsburgh and worked for a startup. The startup got acquired by Red Hat, and they moved us down to North Carolina. That was from like 1999 to 2000. Then Red Hat fired us and I moved back to Pittsburgh. From 2000 to 2005 I worked for a filesystem company in Pittsburgh.</p>
<p><strong>You took a break from writing interactive fiction for a few years after <em>Shade</em>. Then there was a little bit of a shift in focus when you did come back in 2004 with <a href="https://ifdb.org/viewgame?id=3myqnrs64nbtwdaz"><em>The Dreamhold</em></a>. Your earlier games don&#8217;t try too hard to be accessible. When you returned, you seemed more interested in outreach and accessibility. What was the thought process there?</strong></p>
<p>Only the obvious one. It&#8217;s true that all of my previous games were written very much for the community. They were written for people who knew how IF worked. But <em>The Dreamhold</em> was specifically an outreach game. I wanted to try to expand the community. We&#8217;d been doing this for about ten years at that point, and it was kind of the same crowd of people. I thought to create an outreach game as a total wild-ass experiment to try to bring in people from other parts of the gaming world. I didn&#8217;t know whether it would work, but I figured it was worth a try. So I designed a game specifically for that purpose, built around explaining how traditional interactive fiction worked to people who didn&#8217;t know how to play it.</p>
<p>That meant doing some wacky stuff. There are some rooms in <em>The Dreamhold</em> that you enter by going north, but to go back you have to go east, because I figured, this is really uncomfortable, but people are going to run into this if they get into IF, so they should be familiar with the concept. I&#8217;ll try to introduce it as smoothly as possible by putting messages like, &#8220;The corridor turns as you head to the north.&#8221; Then put in the [room] description, &#8220;You can go back the way you came, toward the east,&#8221; to try to make it more tangible. But I wanted to introduce complicated maps and darkness and all of the hardcore stuff that the community was used to. And also make it fun.</p>
<p><strong>There were a number of these outreach efforts at the time. Some people were taking IF games to more conventional game jams. There were cheat sheets of &#8220;how to play IF&#8221; going around. My impression is that these efforts weren&#8217;t super successful. Is that your impression as well?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, it is. None of it actually worked. It&#8217;s great that we made the on-ramps and it&#8217;s good that we still maintain them, but there was not a huge influx of new people coming onto the scene at that point.</p>
<p><strong>My impression is that the community didn&#8217;t really start to grow until it opened itself up to non-parser-driven games: the <a href="https://twinery.org/">Twine</a> games and <a href="https://www.choiceofgames.com/make-your-own-games/choicescript-intro/">ChoiceScript</a> games and so on. Presumably some percentage of those players became willing to try the parser games as well.</strong></p>
<p>Yeah, but that was a little bit later, after 2010 or so. There was still a gap. I decided, well, <em>The Dreamhold</em> didn&#8217;t make an impact, so I&#8217;m just going to go back to writing wacky puzzle games.</p>
<p>Of course, in 2007 <a href="https://ganelson.github.io/inform-website/">Inform 7</a> came out. I would say that drew people into creating games, because it was much more approachable for people who were not C programmers. There was a bit of a revolution there. It was just harder to see because it was new authors rather than new players.</p>
<p><strong>The time around 2010 was an exciting one for you personally as well as the community. In addition to the ongoing buzz about Inform 7, Jason Scott released his <a href="http://getlamp.com/"><em>Get Lamp</em></a> documentary, and you launched <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/zarf/hadean-lands-interactive-fiction-for-the-iphone">a Kickstarter</a> to make a game called <a href="https://ifdb.org/viewgame?id=u58d0mlbfwcorfi"><em>Hadean Lands </em></a>soon after.<br />
</strong></p>
<p>Yes. In 2010, Jason Scott premiered <em>Get Lamp</em> at <a href="https://east.paxsite.com/">PAX East</a>. He had interviewed me two or three years earlier &#8212; probably in 2007.</p>
<p><strong>Yeah, he worked on that movie for almost ten years.</strong></p>
<p>Exactly. It&#8217;s kind of funny to look back at 2007 and see me talking about releasing commercial interactive fiction.</p>
<p>But in 2010, all of the old Infocom guys showed up at PAX East. I was on that panel, sitting with Dave Lebling, Brian Moriarty, and Steve Meretzky. I was going&#8230; [genuflecting]</p>

<p><strong>I&#8217;m not worthy!</strong></p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>Jason Scott brought <em>Get Lamp</em> to a game class at Tufts University a few weeks later. Since I was living about half a mile away, I came in and said, &#8220;Hi, I&#8217;m in this movie.&#8221; Afterward, I went up to Jason and said, &#8220;You know, people are talking about interactive fiction for the first time in fifteen years outside of our little community. Do you think I should do a Kickstarter for a giant IF game?&#8221; And Jason looks at me like I&#8217;ve got bananas growing out of my ears and says, &#8220;Yes, you should!&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>He&#8217;s the most enthusiastic person in the world.</strong></p>
<p>Yes. And of course, he&#8217;d just done a Kickstarter for the <em>Get Lamp</em> release. This was early for Kickstarter. There had been gaming Kickstarter projects before, but no really gigantic ones. So, getting $30,000 for an IF Kickstarter was kind of a big deal in 2010. So I went to the boss at my day job and said, &#8220;Well, I guess this is it for us. I&#8217;m quitting.&#8221; I knew that $30,000 wasn&#8217;t actually going to last me very long, living in Boston. But of course, I&#8217;d been in the software industry for decades by this point, so I had a fair amount of savings cushion built up. And I had a pile of Red Hat stock which was worth some money. I could live on it while I found my footing as an indie developer.</p>
<p><em>The Dreamhold</em> had taken me nine months. I thought <em>Hadean Lands</em> would take me a year. Ha! It turned out that writer&#8217;s block is a hell of a thing. <em>Hadean Lands</em> kept getting sidelined. I got totally knocked over by the idea of doing a hypertext MUD. I spent a year writing that. That was <a href="https://seltani.net/"><em>Seltani</em></a>, which was hugely popular for about two months in the <em>Myst</em> fan community; I did it as a <em>Myst</em> fan game and presented it at a <em>Myst</em> convention. Everybody loved it. But I wasn&#8217;t writing <em>Hadean Lands</em>, and eventually my KickStarter backers started to get upset about that.</p>
<p>I did slog through it. I got <em>Hadean Lands</em> done [in 2014]. I don&#8217;t feel like the story is hugely successful, but I&#8217;m very happy with the puzzle structure and the game layout.</p>
<p><strong>As you know as well as I do, there&#8217;s a whole checkered history of people trying to monetize IF. A few years ago, <a href="/tag/bates/?order=asc">Bob Bates</a> of Infocom and Legend fame released <a href="https://www.thaumistry.com/"><em>Thaumistry</em></a>. I was a beta-tester on that game. The game was very good, but these things just never work. It&#8217;s always a disappointment in the end. Nobody has ever cracked that code.</strong></p>
<p>If you look at the <em>Thaumistry</em> Kickstarter and the <em>Hadean Lands</em> Kickstarter, you see that they made almost the same amount of money from almost the same number of backers. It&#8217;s the same crowd showing up: &#8220;Yeah, we still love ya!&#8221; But they&#8217;re not enough to make a living from&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>The problem is getting outside of that crowd.</strong></p>
<p>It&#8217;s no wonder that people like <a href="https://emshort.blog/">Emily Short</a> have long since decamped, saying, &#8220;I have to work on different kinds of games with a larger reach.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>What about you? Do you think you will ever return to parser-based interactive fiction?</strong></p>
<p>That&#8217;s a fair question. I&#8217;ve had a lot of starts toward things that I thought might be interesting. I started working on a framework for a kind of text game that&#8217;s not parser-based but also not hypertext in the sense that Twine is. It&#8217;s more combinatoric. I got two-thirds of the way done with building the engine and one-third of the way done with writing a game, then I kind of lost it. But I still think it&#8217;s interesting and I might go back to it. I don&#8217;t think it would go big the way Twine did, but it might reach a different audience. It&#8217;s a different way of thinking about the game structure.</p>
<p><strong>Would you care to talk about your partnership with Jason Shiga to turn his interactive comic books into digital apps? I have played <a href="https://zarfhome.com/meanwhile/"><em>Meanwhile</em></a>, the first of those.</strong></p>
<p>Sure. I&#8217;d been aware of Jason Shiga ever since I started hanging out with Nick Montfort at MIT after I moved to Boston. Nick had a bunch of his early self-published stuff. He had the original printing of <em>Meanwhile</em>, as a black-and-white hand-cut book. I thought it was really neat.</p>
<p>Totally by coincidence, <em>Meanwhile</em> got picked up by a publisher just before that 2010 PAX East we talked about. <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7229730-meanwhile">A nice big hardback version</a> of it was published. It was being sold at PAX East. I thought, man, this is great, I&#8217;d really love to do an iPhone version. This was 2010; iPhone games were big.</p>
<p>A little later, I did the <em>Hadean Lands</em> Kickstarter and quit my job. I needed to have more projects than just one text adventure, so I wrote to Jason Shiga and said, &#8220;Hey, I&#8217;m a big fan. I&#8217;d love to do an app version of your book.&#8221; Jason was amenable, so we had the usual conversations with lawyers and agents and signed a contract. I worked on that at the same time that I was planning out <em>Hadean Lands</em>. The iPhone app came out in 2011.</p>
<p><strong>So, the finances of making a go of it as an independent creator of digital content without a day job didn&#8217;t quite pan out for you in the end. I feel your pain, believe me. It&#8217;s a hard row to hoe. What came next?</strong></p>
<p>After <em>Meanwhile</em> and <em>Hadean Lands</em>, I felt very stuck. Jason [Shiga] was off working on non-interactive comics, so there wasn&#8217;t anything to do there. I bummed around for a while trying to find something that would make any kind of money at all, but I was not successful.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m skipping over huge chunks of time here, but in 2017 Emily Short and <a href="https://aaronareed.net/">Aaron Reed</a> were working on a project to do NPC dialog as a commercial product. It was essentially taking Emily&#8217;s old ideas about threaded dialog in parser games and turning them into a plugin which game designers could use in any game to have interesting multi-threaded conversations. I spent a couple of years working on that project with them. But it turned out that management at that company sucked and everybody bailed.</p>
<p>Since then until this year, I&#8217;ve been working for big and small games studios, working on the dialog parts of their games.</p>
<p><strong>Coding dialog engines or writing dialog?</strong></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been a software engineer, working on the coding part, but working with the writers.</p>
<p>Also during this period, Jason Shiga started writing what he calls <a href="https://www.abramsbooks.com/product/adventuregame-comics-the-beyond-book-2_9781419757815/">&#8220;Adventuregame Comics,&#8221;</a> which are shorter <em>Meanwhile</em>-style books. I&#8217;ve started porting those. The Steam port of <a href="https://zarfhome.com/thebeyond/"><em>The Beyond</em></a> and the iOS and Steam port of <a href="https://zarfhome.com/leviathan/"><em>Leviathan</em></a> are available now. The iOS port of <em>The Beyond</em> will be coming later.</p>
<p><strong>Since <em>Hadean Lands</em>, you&#8217;ve stepped into more of an organizing role in the IF community. </strong></p>
<p>Yes. I&#8217;m very proud to have transitioned from being a hotshot game writer to someone who is doing community support, building structures and traditions and conferences. I never wanted to be a person who was only famous for writing games, especially after I started writing fewer games. I <em>really</em> didn&#8217;t want to be a person who was famous for having been a big game writer in the 1990s. That&#8217;s a sucky position to be stuck in. There needs to be a second act.</p>
<p><strong>It&#8217;s maybe a maturation process as well. When you get a little bit older, you realize that some things are important in a way you may not have when you were a young, hotshot game writer.</strong></p>
<p>Yeah. I slowed down writing games because I started to second-guess myself too much. When you&#8217;ve written a lot of games that people got really excited about&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>Then you&#8217;re competing with your own back catalog.</strong></p>
<p>It doesn&#8217;t feel good. I&#8217;ve had trouble getting away from that.</p>
<p><strong>You&#8217;ve done most of your organizational work in the context of the <a href="https://iftechfoundation.org/">Interactive Fiction Technology Foundation</a>, so maybe we should talk about that more specifically. I&#8217;ll give you my impression of the reasons for its founding, and you can tell me if I&#8217;m right. You and some other people decided it would be wise to institutionalize things a little bit more, so that the community is no longer so dependent on individuals who come and go. With a foundation and a funding model and all of these institutional aspects, hopefully you set up the community for the long haul, so that it can survive if a server goes down or someone goes away.</strong></p>
<p>Yeah, that&#8217;s exactly where it started. We&#8217;d been running for decades on people just setting up a server somewhere and saying, &#8220;Hey, I&#8217;ll run this thing!&#8221; That was the original IF Archive, the Usenet newsgroups, IF Comp, the Interactive Fiction Database, the IF Forum. It was workable, but everything was being paid out of somebody&#8217;s pocket. There wasn&#8217;t a lot of discussion about who was doing what or how much it cost. There was no fallback plan and no thinking about what would come next if somebody stopped doing something. Like, there was a long period when IFDB wasn&#8217;t getting any updates because Mike Roberts had a day job. Some things about it were clunky and hard to use, but you couldn&#8217;t fix them.</p>
<p>So, in 2015 or early 2016, <a href="https://jmac.org/">Jason McIntosh</a>, who was running the IF Comp at that point, had a conversation with somebody who said, &#8220;Why don&#8217;t you have a non-profit organization to support the IF Comp? Then you could get donations from people.&#8221; And Jason started running around in circles with a gleam in his eye, saying, &#8220;Yes! We should do this! We should do this! Whom do I know who can help?&#8221; He started talking to other people who were longtime supporters of things in the community. That included Chris Klimas, who had been supporting Twine for three or four years, and me &#8212; I&#8217;d been supporting the IF Archive for a while. Then <a href="https://www.polygamer.net/2016/01/13/pg37-carolyn-vaneseltine/">Carolyn VanEseltine</a> and <a href="https://www.flourishklink.com/">Flourish Klink</a> joined. Flourish was the only one who knew how to set up a non-profit. They had run a Harry Potter fan conference as a teenager, and, being excited and not knowing things were hard, had just done it.</p>
<p>We got into contact with the same lawyer Flourish had used. The lawyer told us what we needed: forms, bylaws, etc. Jason was the first president, I was the first treasurer. We went down to my bank and opened a business account for the organization. Then we wrote to the IRS to become a 501 C3 non-profit. We set up a website, found someone to give us a basic Web design and a logo. Then we announced it.</p>
<p>At the start, we just did the <a href="https://ifcomp.org">IF Comp</a>; we collected about $8000 that first year for a prize pool. But over the course of the first couple of years, we added Twine and the <a href="https://www.ifarchive.org/">IF Archive</a>. The <a href="https://intfiction.org/">IF Forum</a> was the next big addition. Then the <a href="https://www.ifwiki.org/Main_Page">IF Wiki</a> and <a href="https://ifdb.org/">IFDB</a>. Today each has its own steering group. And we have a grants committee now.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://narrascope.org/">The NarraScope conference</a> is another IFTF project. Would you like to tell a bit about that?</strong></p>
<p>That was my idea. I&#8217;d always been keen on the idea of having a narrative-game-oriented conference. I&#8217;d been going to <a href="https://gdconf.com/">GDC</a> for many years. GDC has a sub-track, a narrative-game summit, which is where people like Emily Short and <a href="https://www.inklestudios.com/about/">Jon Ingold</a> hang out. But it&#8217;s a very tiny slice of what GDC is. And of course GDC is expensive, so it&#8217;s hard to bring in the hobbyists and the indie people and the people who write IF Comp games. They just can&#8217;t afford GDC. I wanted to provide an alternative that was more approachable and affordable and friendly.</p>
<p>Once we as an organization had steady members and contributors and could bring in money, I said, &#8220;It&#8217;s time to think about a conference. Our first <em>de novo</em> project.&#8221; So, I talked to people I knew who had been involved in conferences, like the <em>Myst</em> fan conference, which is a very tiny thing that happens every year, like 100 people. But it&#8217;s been going for years and years. And of course Flourish had run a fan conference.</p>
<p>In 2017 or 2018, I went to GDC with a bunch of business cards that said, &#8220;We want to run an interactive-fiction, adventure, and narrative-oriented game conference. Want to help us?&#8221; I handed one to everybody I talked to. I found a bunch of people who were interested in helping. Nick Montfort said he could get us a space at MIT for the event relatively cheap. We put up a call for speakers, a website, etc. We were coordinating with the IFTF Education Committee, which is run by Judith Pintar, who goes all the way back to <a href="/2018/09/shades-of-gray"><em>Shades of Gray</em></a>.</p>
<p><strong>Yeah, I had <a href="/2018/01/a-conversation-with-judith-pintar">a great talk with Judith</a> some years ago now.</strong></p>
<p>I had strong opinions about how a friendly conference should feel. We had to bring in lunch so people would sit around and have conversations rather than splitting up and running all over Cambridge. I wanted long breaks between talks so people would have space to socially interact. I wanted badges that didn&#8217;t distinguish between speakers and attendees; we&#8217;re all here, and we&#8217;re not going to have superstars. I wanted an open and honest tone.</p>
<p>We made sure to have a keynote speaker who wasn&#8217;t an old fart. We didn&#8217;t want somebody like Scott Adams coming in and talking about what it was like back in the 1980s.</p>
<p><strong>You didn&#8217;t want to become a retro-gaming conference.</strong></p>
<p>Right. And we deliberately made the scope larger than just interactive fiction as found in the IF Comp or the IFDB. We didn&#8217;t want to limit the conference to those topics. We kept the admission price down to about $85.</p>
<p>That was <a href="https://2019.narrascope.org/">2019</a>. We had about 250 people, and everything miraculously went perfectly. The worst disaster was when the Dunkin&#8217; Donuts guy was dropping off coffee and hot cocoa. One of the urns blew its spout and dumped gallons of cocoa all over the floor. Someone said, &#8220;I know where there&#8217;s a mop,&#8221; and went and got the mop and cleaned it up. Great, let&#8217;s have the rest of the conference!</p>
<p>Local game companies made contributions, maybe $500 or $1000. Between that and the registration fees, the conference broke even. I admit that I threw in $2000 myself to make it balance, but that was because we splurged out and rented a bar on Sunday night. I said, okay, I&#8217;ll cover that, so that everybody can go out and have pizza and beer.</p>

Time for pizza and beer!</p></div>
<p>It was a huge success. We said we would do it again next year. But of course next year was 2020. You know how that story goes.</p>
<p>But it was exciting enough that we wanted to keep going anyway, so we had an online event in <a href="https://2020.narrascope.org/">2020</a>. We skipped 2021, then came back in <a href="https://2022.narrascope.org/">2022</a> with an online conference. Then we had a hybrid model for <a href="https://2023.narrascope.org/">2023</a> in Pittsburgh and <a href="http://2024.narrascope.org/">2024</a> in Rochester. And that&#8217;s the history of the thing in a nutshell. By now I&#8217;ve become just an advisor, which is a great relief.</p>
<p><strong>How many people have attended the later conferences?</strong></p>
<p>It&#8217;s very easy to attend an online conference, so about 500 or 600 people signed up for those. But in person in Pittsburgh, there were about 100, either because people didn&#8217;t want to travel in the pandemic era or because we were offering an online option, so a lot of people who could have showed up decided to stay home and watch the stream instead. This year was a little higher, like 120.</p>
<p><strong>You were at <a href="https://www.museumofplay.org/">the Strong Museum of Play</a> in Rochester this year?</strong></p>
<p>Yeah. The space was spread out, which turned out to be a win, because we had to walk through the museum and walk past all the cool exhibits. People were jumping out between talks to explore the museum. It was a really neat space &#8212; but unfortunately more expensive than a university.</p>
<p><strong>And there will be another conference in 2025?</strong></p>
<p>There absolutely will. It&#8217;s going to be in Philadelphia at Drexel University. NarraScope has not yet become big enough to replace GDC, but we&#8217;re optimistic. [smile]</p>
<p><strong>I don&#8217;t think you want that. It becomes very bureaucratic and soulless.</strong></p>
<p>Yeah, obviously. But <a href="https://jabortnick.com/">Justin Bortnick</a>, who is the current IFTF president, has been talking to GDC about booth space to present IFTF on the show floor. <a href="https://gamehistory.org/">The Video Game History Foundation</a> had a booth there this year. We thought, we&#8217;re educational too! We could do that! It may actually happen.</p>
<p><strong>Maybe we can wind up this conversation by talking about the current status of the IF community itself. For many years, it seemed to be quite stagnant in terms of numbers. We already talked about the outreach efforts that took place around 2005 and largely did not succeed. But about five years later, the hypertext systems started to come online. There was a big jump at that point. If you look at the number of games entered in the Comp, they actually trend down through the 2000s, then suddenly there&#8217;s a big spike around 2010 to 2012. They&#8217;ve stayed at quite a high level since then. Do you have a sense of whether these new, presumably younger people are jumping over to the parser-based stuff as well?</strong></p>
<p>There are new faces on both sides. There is now an active group of retro-fans interested in parser games. That is, people who are excited about making new games and running them on Commodore 64s and the like. We had to update Inform to fix the support for the version 3 Z-Machine, which had been broken over time as everybody was writing bigger and bigger games. Now people want to write small games again.</p>
<p>And there is more interest in <a href="https://versificator.itch.io/gruescript">hybrid systems</a>, intermediate models which are neither pure hypertext nor pure parser. For years and years, there were no new parser tools. I thought the last great parser development systems had already been implemented; people would stick with <a href="https://tads.org/">TADS 3</a> and Inform 7 forever. Then a parser system called <a href="https://linusakesson.net/dialog/">Dialog</a> appeared, which is a little bit different from them.</p>
<p>But there is certainly more energy on the hypertext side, especially because a lot of us old farts have drifted away. I&#8217;m not writing games anymore, Emily Short isn&#8217;t writing text games anymore, Jon Ingold and Aaron Reed went off and did their things, Adam Cadre went off to work on film scripts. There are new people writing new games, but I think the pool is going to shrink over time. But that&#8217;s okay. Everything that Jon Ingold has done at <a href="https://www.inklestudios.com/">Inkle Studios</a> is informed by the early text games he worked on and how he wanted to expand that to reach a bigger audience. Everything Sam Barlow has done &#8212; <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/game/73651/her-story/"><em>Her Story</em></a>, <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/game/133460/telling-les/"><em>Telling L!es</em></a>, <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/game/190202/immortality/"><em>Immortality</em></a> &#8212; is informed by his experience writing <a href="https://ifdb.org/viewgame?id=j49crlvd62mhwuzu">text games</a>. The same goes for Emily Short. It&#8217;s still part of the conversation. It&#8217;s just not the center of it anymore.</p>
<p><strong>Yeah. This is a discussion I&#8217;ve had from time to time since I started this site. My opinion is that when our generation dies that will probably mark the end of parser-based text adventures. You can say that&#8217;s tragic if you want to. At the same time, though, nobody&#8217;s writing plays like Shakespeare anymore, but Shakespeare&#8217;s plays are still out there.</strong></p>
<p>And there&#8217;s still theater.</p>
<p><strong>Yeah. Trends in interactive media, just the same as others forms of entertainment and art, come and go. They have their time, and then their time is over. I&#8217;m quite at peace with that.</strong></p>
<p>I&#8217;m sort of handicapped by the fact that I haven&#8217;t played IF Comp games in quite a while.</p>
<p><strong>I haven&#8217;t either. To be honest, I&#8217;ve played almost nothing made in the last ten years, just because I have so many old games on the syllabus for this site. Having too many games to play is not the worst problem to have, but it&#8217;s made me kind of a time traveler. I live in the past in that sense.</strong></p>
<p>I do know that <a href="https://ifdb.org/viewgame?id=j0sata4yi32bi2xj">this year&#8217;s IF Comp winner</a> was by <a href="https://www.castleprincessdragon.com/">Chandler Groover</a>. I don&#8217;t think he&#8217;s our age. <a href="https://ifdb.org/showuser?id=sewum1c69z4rchuz">Ryan Veeder</a> is younger than us.</p>
<p><strong>I do look at the Comp website sometimes to see what&#8217;s going on. I&#8217;ve noticed that it still seems to be a parser-based game that actually wins the thing most of the time. That&#8217;s a sign of something, I guess.</strong></p>
<p>Yeah. Maybe it&#8217;s a sign of old farts hanging on too long? But seriously, I think there is a new generation of parser-game authors. Whether it&#8217;s big enough to sustain itself after you and I are doddering in a nursing home, I don&#8217;t know.</p>
<p><strong>There&#8217;s been so much progress with computer understanding of natural language. A lot of it is associated with large language models, of course, which is a fraught subject in itself. But I could imagine a system &#8212; a front-end &#8212; that could take natural language and translate that into something a traditional parser could more readily understand, then funnel it through even an old text adventure. I&#8217;m kind of surprised I haven&#8217;t heard of anything like that.</strong></p>
<p>Someone did do that as an experiment and posted about it on the forum. Experimenting both with using LLMs on the input side to translate natural language into parserese, and also on the output side to translate generic room descriptions into more flowery, expanded text. I&#8217;m more interested in the input side because I like hand-crafted output, but that&#8217;s getting into the whole question of AI.</p>
<p><strong>Yes, I have no interest whatsoever in reading AI-generated text in any context.<br />
</strong></p>
<p>I think there wasn&#8217;t a lot of uptake on that idea just because the kind of people who are excited about AI aren&#8217;t excited about parser games in the first place. There have been several attempts to make an AI-generated text adventure, but they&#8217;ve all been by people who were not good at text adventures and didn&#8217;t know what they wanted out of it. There&#8217;s <a href="https://aidungeon.com/"><em>AI Dungeon</em></a>, which uses an LLM to pretend to be a parser game. But because it&#8217;s all AI generated, it doesn&#8217;t really produce anything interesting.</p>
<p>The people who are interested in making parser games are mostly old-fashioned artisans who want to hand-craft everything and are not motivated to dive into AI as a shiny new pool. It might be different if someone who was an established parser-game author jumped in and wholeheartedly tried to make it happen. Revolutions are the result of one person getting involved and building something that takes off. Someone has to actually do the work. And to this point, nobody has done that. It&#8217;s very possible the whole AI thing will collapse in six months anyway.</p>
<p><strong>I think that&#8217;s a very good possibility, but I think that if it does, it will leave behind some pieces in the rubble that are actually useful. Maybe a solution to our parsing problems can be one of them.</strong></p>
<p><strong>But I&#8217;ve kept you long enough. Thanks so much for the talk!</strong></p>
<p>Thank you!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In 2002, Paul O&#8217;Brian, a prolific author, reviewer, and commentator on the contemporary interactive-fiction scene, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160308050545/http://ministryofpeace.com/if-review/reviews/20020412.html">attempted to compile a list</a> of those people who had done the most to help text adventures live on beyond <a href="/2016/07/going-to-california">the death of Infocom</a>. Among the names he listed were those of Mike Roberts and <a href="/2019/11/new-tricks-for-an-old-z-machine-part-2-hacking-deeper-or-follies-of-graham-nelsons-youth">Graham Nelson</a>, the creators of <a href="/2017/02/tads">TADS</a> and <a href="/2019/11/new-tricks-for-an-old-z-machine-part-3-a-renaissance-is-nigh">Inform</a>; Andrew Plotkin, who contributed crucial technical innovations of his own and authored a number of perplexing, intriguing games; and Adam Cadre, who wrote the single most-played text adventure of the post-Infocom era. None of these names will come as a surprise to anyone who has been even a casual tourist of the interactive-fiction scene over the years. But another of them very well might: that of Gerry Kevin &#8220;Whizzard&#8221; Wilson. And yet one can make an argument that his skill set was the most unique and thus the most essential of them all.</p>
<p>It will presumably come as a shock to no one when I write that those folks who were still happy to play games consisting of nothing but text in the era of multimedia and 3D tended to be as quiet and bookish as the games themselves. Such personality types are not overly known for their organizing or marketing acumen. The burgeoning interactive-fiction community was thus incredibly lucky to have Wilson, who was the exception to the rule of introversion. An Infocom superfan who just couldn&#8217;t bear to see text adventures go gentle into that good night, he became an activist and community organizer <em>par excellence</em>.</p>
<p>In May of 1994, when he was just eighteen years old, Wilson published the first issue of an electronic newsletter which he called <a href="http://www.spagmag.org/archives/backissues.html">SPAG</a>: &#8220;Society for the Preservation of Adventure Games.&#8221; Later, when it was concluded that text adventures as a species were no longer actively endangered, the word &#8220;Preservation&#8221; was changed to &#8220;Promotion.&#8221; By whatever name, SPAG served as the journal of record of the community from 1994 until 2010, a clearinghouse for reviews of the latest games along with news, announcements, and commentary. (Yours truly was the last long-serving editor of SPAG, just before I became a digital antiquarian&#8230;)</p>
<p>It was Wilson as well who reached out to Activision, the <a href="/2019/04/an-unlikely-savior">corporate inheritor of the Infocom legacy</a>. He found an ally there in one Laird Malamed, the project leader of <a href="/2024/06/the-last-days-of-zork"><em>Zork: Grand Inquisitor</em></a>, Activision&#8217;s third and last graphical <em>Zork</em> adventure game. Together, Wilson and Malamed sneaked half a dozen recent amateur-authored text adventures onto the <em>Masterpieces of Infocom</em> shovelware collection. The writers of same even received actual, albeit small, royalty checks for their efforts, meaning that they were, technically speaking, amateurs no longer.</p>
<p>Then Wilson convinced the ex-Infocom authors <a href="/tag/blank/?order=asc">Marc Blank</a> and <a href="/tag/berlyn/?order=asc">Mike Berlyn</a> to write <a href="https://ifdb.org/viewgame?id=40hswtkhap88gzvn">one last text-only <em>Zork</em></a>, which he himself implemented using Graham Nelson&#8217;s Inform programming language and which Activision officially released as a free taster for <em>Grand Inquisitor</em>. These efforts helped to inspire Berlyn to start a new company called Cascade Mountain Publishing; a commercial game <a href="https://ifdb.org/viewgame?id=vlsvsfinckq930o5">from Kevin Wilson</a> and one <a href="https://ifdb.org/viewgame?id=s261gocee0qwv4rs">from Mike Berlyn and his wife Muffy</a> became its only two digital releases. (I&#8217;ll have more to say about that ambitious if doomed effort in a later article.) It&#8217;s hard to image anyone else in the amateur community orchestrating such sweeping outreach to the world of games beyond the Usenet newsgroups where the Infocom diehards hung out.</p>
<p>But for all the other things he accomplished through his sheer energy, likability, and enthusiasm, the core of Wilson&#8217;s claim to being the Indispensable Man in the community will always come down to a single one of the hundreds of messages he posted to Usenet during the 1990s. On June 26, 1995, he announced &#8220;The First Annual Text Adventure Authorship Competition,&#8221; whose purpose was &#8220;to inspire authors to write something, however small, and make it available for people to play. Interactive fiction as a hobby cannot survive unless there are people out there writing and playing it. Hopefully, some of the people who enter the competition will enjoy it, and decide to write more on their own.&#8221;</p>
<p>Entrants had to be submitted by September 1 of that year, which in and of itself precluded them from being very long, assuming that each author began his game just for the competition. The entrants were divided into two categories, one for those created with TADS, the other for those created with Inform. The final tally was six entrants in each of the categories, for a dozen new games in all, a massive bounty by the standards of the time. The winners, determined by a popular community vote after a month in which to play the games had elapsed, were Magnus Olsson&#8217;s <a href="https://ifdb.org/viewgame?id=q1gts4stibzdzy69"><em>Uncle Zebulon&#8217;s Will</em></a> on the TADS side and Andrew Plotkin&#8217;s <a href="https://ifdb.org/viewgame?id=00wlim27k5d1hmf2"><em>A Change in the Weather</em></a> on the Inform side.</p>
<p>Already in this very first year, the entrants bore many of the hallmarks of Comps to come. Some of them were unabashedly experimental in form: Gareth Rees&#8217;s <a href="https://ifdb.org/viewgame?id=52x2zxt8ers4rxc0"><em>The Magic Toyshop</em></a> took place entirely within a single room; C.E. Forman&#8217;s <a href="https://ifdb.org/viewgame?id=imopnqh4llwkvfne"><em>Mystery Science Theater 3000 Presents &#8220;Detective&#8221;</em></a> (say that three times fast!) was a meta-textual roasting of a really bad earlier game; Neil deMause&#8217;s <a href="https://ifdb.org/viewgame?id=7aggx56jw5331v1c"><em>Undo</em></a> expected you the player to work around the bugs in another terrible, broken game, a (meta-)fictional one this time. Such games would almost certainly never have come to exist without a Comp to give their authors permission to work on a smaller scale, one that lent itself to such single-concept creations. It encouraged authors to pursue other goals than that of simply being as good as Infocom at the things which Infocom had done best. In this sense, the advent of the Comp marked the beginning of the end of what I referred to as the community&#8217;s &#8220;neoclassical&#8221; phase <a href="/2021/09/the-neo-classical-interactive-fiction-of-1995">in an earlier article</a>.</p>
<p>The next year, the same event, now known as The Interactive Fiction Competition, was held again, without the rather pointless division into TADS and Inform categories; authors could now freely choose to use either of those development systems or any other, knowing their games would be judged alongside their peers without favor or prejudice. Another significant change was that the Comp was now more explicitly branded as being for <em>short</em> games, ideally &#8220;playable in two hours or less.&#8221; This time, it attracted no fewer than 26 entrants, and was won by Graham Nelson&#8217;s <a href="https://ifdb.org/viewgame?id=273o81yvg64m4pkz"><em>The Meteor, the Stone, and a Long Glass of Sherbet</em></a>.</p>
<p>Kevin Wilson unplugged himself from the community after 1998, to aim his prodigious energies in other directions. He became a prominent designer of hobbyist board games, ones that usually had a pronounced narrative thrust and that sometimes borrowed their names and themes from popular digital games like <a href="/2020/06/the-shareware-scene-part-4-doom"><em>DOOM</em></a>, <a href="/2023/06/a-dialog-in-real-time-strategy"><em>Warcraft</em></a>, and <a href="/2018/03/the-game-of-everything-part-1-making-civilization"><em>Civilization</em></a>. Yet his legacy lives on in interactive fiction in the form of <a href="https://ifcomp.org">the IF Comp</a>, whose 30th installment has been recently concluded as of this writing. Throughout the last three decades, it has remained <em>the</em> essential event on the community&#8217;s annual calendar, the sun around which everything else revolves. For community stalwarts, its arrival each year has become as indelible a marker of autumn as the changing color of the leaves, pumpkins on display on roadside stands, and the first nips of Old Man Winter on the breeze.</p>
<p>The positives and negatives of building a community around the IF Comp have been discussed and debated <em>ad nauseam</em> over the years. On the one hand, it surely did encourage many people to take a stab at writing a text adventure who would not have done so back in the days when these games were expected to be as big as one of Infocom&#8217;s if they were to be taken seriously. Then, too, as we&#8217;ve already seen, it actively encouraged experimentation and innovation. The late 1990s were chock-a-block with games that departed radically from <a href="/2012/01/exploring-zork-part-1">the points-for-treasure model of <em>Zork</em></a>: <a href="https://ifdb.org/viewgame?id=7s3fedb0zhcvza7f">self-consciously literary games</a>, <a href="https://ifdb.org/viewgame?id=3a9rb059miw9fc9h">games written in bizarre forms of language</a>, <a href="https://ifdb.org/viewgame?id=fn8r65rg7upfff0o">one-room games</a>, even <a href="https://ifdb.org/viewgame?id=j49crlvd62mhwuzu">a very well received <em>one-turn</em> game</a>.</p>
<p>On the other hand, however, the Comp came to suck up so much of the communal oxygen that some authors felt obligated to enter it in order to get their games noticed at all. And this in turn caused them to write to the specific set of constraints which it encouraged. Although games lasting longer than two hours were never outright disqualified in the official rules, they were guaranteed to provoke some degree of anger among harried judges for being &#8220;too long for the Comp,&#8221; with some voters giving them bad scores on principle for that sin alone. This produced a not-so-subtle pressure not to make bigger games at all anymore.</p>
<p>On the other other hand, though, the extent of that pressure was probably exaggerated by some. Certainly a steady dribble of big games did continue to appear outside the Comp throughout the latter half of the 1990s. Indeed, an article which I&#8217;m planning to write for this site next year will focus on the surprising number of absolutely <em>huge</em> games &#8212; most of them far <em>bigger</em> than any made by Infocom &#8212; that appeared in 1998 and 1999 alone.</p>
<p>Having said that, I must admit that I do have my fair share of issues with the sorts of games that the Comps of the late 1990s tended to produce. For all that this period may have been a necessary phase for the community to pass through if it was to begin to escape the long shadow of Infocom, a lot of the games themselves really haven&#8217;t aged all that well in my opinion. When works in any creative medium start to prioritize meta-textual cleverness &#8212; when they become primarily commentaries on the nature of the medium itself instead of the wider world around it &#8212; insularity tends to be the result. It&#8217;s hard to exempt the interactive-fiction community from this charge &#8212; not by the time it was releasing elaborate in-jokes like J. Robinson Wheeler&#8217;s <a href="https://ifdb.org/viewgame?id=q8y5zup88c9hu499"><em>Being Andrew Plotkin</em></a>, which replaced the hero of the film <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120601"><em>Being John Malkovich</em></a> with the titular author of modern text adventures. The cliquish &#8212; not to say incestuous &#8212; feel of games like this did nothing to welcome newcomers into the fold.</p>
<p>Of course, such complaints by no means apply to every single Comp entrant of this period. I&#8217;ve brought them up here mainly in order to explain why some types of games will <em>not</em> be much in evidence in the rest of this article, nor in any others on these subjects that might follow it in the future. The late 1990s also brought its share of fine games that are complete in themselves, with no knowledge of the community and its personalities or any of its raging debates about the theory and practice of interactive fiction required. In fact, 1998 can be reasonably called the interactive-fiction community&#8217;s best single year in all its history, in that it produced no fewer than three of the most widely played post-commercial text adventures of all time, all of which are included in the little roundup that follows. Each of the games below is possessed of its own authorial voice, distinct from that of any of the people who worked for Infocom. And yet each is as finely calibrated a marriage of plot, place, and puzzles as any of the best games of Infocom &#8212; with just one exception, that is, whose reasons for appearing on this list nevertheless will be made clear in due course.</p>
<p>In short, whether it&#8217;s your first text adventure or your thousandth, I do think you can enjoy any of the games on this roundup. In the former case, you will have to put in a bit of effort to <a href="http://pr-if.org/doc/play-if-card/">familiarize yourself</a> with the conventions of the form &#8212; but trust me, it&#8217;s not all that hard and it&#8217;s eminently worth it.</p>
<p>So, why not pick a game and give it a shot? What have you got to lose? Of all the virtues of the text adventures of the 1990s and beyond, the most undeniable is the fact that almost all of them are entirely free. You can try any of these games directly in your browser by clicking the &#8220;PLAY ONLINE&#8221; link. If you decide to stay with it, you may want to download an offline interpreter and the story file. For the former, I recommend <a href="https://ccxvii.net/gargoyle/">an application called Gargoyle</a>, which will play all of the games below. For the latter, you&#8217;ll want to look on the right side of the Interactive Fiction Database page for each game, which you get to by clicking on its title below. (You always want the latest release, generally the first on the list.) <a href="https://www.trizbort.com/">Trizbort</a> is a handy application for making maps of the territory you explore. I find filling in a map to be a joy of its own.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve included below a very rough guess as to how long it might take the typical person to play each game. But keep in mind that it&#8217;s only a guess. All of these games deserve to be savored for however long strikes you as appropriate.</p>

<p><code>"This is it!" he says as he dodges the last pothole and brings the truck to a stop. After twenty miles of the worst washboard road the country has to offer, you're just happy to have arrived.</code></p>
<p><code>You place your sandaled feet on solid ground and take a deep breath. The smells of autumn are at once sweet and earthy and full of the aroma of moisture and living things. A cool breeze blows in your face, soft and gentle. What a nice change, what a welcome relief from the tension and hustle of all you've left behind this weekend. It's just you and your husband, as he promised over a month ago.</code></p>
<p><code>You look around. What passes for the road you just traveled ends abruptly here. Over the last hour, bad asphalt gave way to gravel, which gave way, in turn, to the rutted two-track you see beside you. Ahead, the ruts continue, but it'll be on foot if you're to go any further. The old beater truck stands here, engine off but still ticking from the trip. Your husband closes the driver's door and comes around the rear to join you.</code></p>
<p><code>"How's my pretty lady?" he asks as he wraps his arms around you and places a kiss on your cheek from behind. "Tired, huh? Come on. Let's get the stuff. We'll be able to relax better once the tent's up."</code><br />
<code><br />
He takes the two packs from the back of the truck and helps you into yours, then leads the way through the brush to the north. You roll up on the balls of your feet and give your pack a nudge, then pull the waist strap tight. Without looking back, you follow.</code></p>
<p><code>That was last night, and you hiked a short trail to a campsite off in the woods. Together you set up the tent, fixed a quick dinner, and fell asleep in each other's arms...</code><br />
<code> </code></p>
<p><code>You wake with a start, something's missing, and you notice the sleeping bag is empty beside you. On his pillow is a handwritten note, which you collect. He must have crawled out early, as the sky is only now beginning to lighten.</code></p>
<p><code>You dress quickly, slip out of the tent, and follow the trail to the east.</code><br />
<code> </code></p>
<p><code><strong>Aspen Grove</strong><br />
You stand in the middle of a grove of aspen, which extends in all directions. Slender white trunks reach for the sky with long thin fingers, stroking the clouds that blow in the autumn breeze. Leaves of gold rattle as the winds shift, and here and there one floats to the ground to join others that crackle underfoot when you move. A narrow path disappears east into the trees, and a camping area is visible through a small opening to the west. North is a wide meadow.</code></p>
<p>I was better equipped to appreciate <em>She&#8217;s Got a Thing for a Spring</em> when I played it fairly recently than I was when I first encountered it quite some years ago. For it seems that the older I get, the more I just want to be outside walking. In fact, I replayed this game while my wife and I were on a walking holiday in Tuscany, on a morning when the rain was coming down so heavily that there wasn&#8217;t anything for it but to stay at our hotel. I sat there on our covered balcony for several hours with my laptop and <em>She&#8217;s Got a Thing for a Spring</em>, while the rain pattered and the thunder boomed. I can&#8217;t imagine a more perfect soundtrack for this game. Then the storm blew itself out and we went walking again for real.</p>
<p>In <em>She&#8217;s Got a Thing for a Spring</em>, which took fourth place in the 1997 IF Comp, you play a wife whose husband has arranged a special treat for your fifth wedding anniversary: a visit to a hidden hot spring somewhere in Colorado or thereabouts. Just to keep it interesting &#8212; and to give us a game &#8212; he&#8217;s first challenged her to find the spring for herself. The stakes are no higher than that. Nor, it must be said, do they need to be.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s more personal experience behind this particular interactive fiction than is commonplace in the genre. Beginning one year before and continuing for fourteen years after he released it, <a href="http://cameraontheroad.com/">our author Brent VanFossen lived full-time with his wife Lorelle in a motor home</a>, exploring the natural wonders of the Americas. He wrote <em>She&#8217;s Got a Thing for a Spring</em>, he tells us in his &#8220;about&#8221; text, as a gift for Lorelle on her birthday. His love for nature and for his wife comes through in every word. There&#8217;s a distinct whiff of sensuality to his descriptions of both; said wife is, after all, trying to join him at a hot spring for a secret, skinny-dipping, midnight tryst. In some other games where a male author has tried to embody a female protagonist, it&#8217;s gone horribly wrong, coming across as handsy adolescent leering. But this is not that. It&#8217;s sexy but not raunchy, sensual but not exploitive. Just the way these things ought to be, in other words.</p>
<p><em>She&#8217;s Got a Thing for a Spring</em> garnered a lot of attention back in the day for the one non-player character with whom you can interact extensively, who is actually not the husband. (He shows up in the flesh only for the last couple of turns.) Said character is rather a humble fellow named Bob, a grandfatherly sort who&#8217;s retired to a quiet life in a little cabin in the woods. You can talk to him about an impressive number of topics, both relevant and irrelevant to your quest, as he putters about his house, sweeping the porch, repairing an old rocking chair, picking lettuce and tomatoes and strawberries, making sandwiches for lunch and strawberry shortcake for dessert, fixing a loose plank and re-caulking his windows, painting a picture in watercolors. Throughout, he natters away pleasantly about his chores and about bigger subjects, such as the wife he lost (&#8220;Cancer got her, and we never even knew it until it was too late&#8221;) and the brother who is coming for a visit soon (&#8220;Joe&#8217;s an engineer, works on all those commercial jet airplanes in the Northwest&#8221;). This is a man who has clearly known pain and loss, yet also one who is completely at peace with himself and his life. Some of that serenity rubs off on the player who spends time with him &#8212; or it did on this player, at least. Plus, his strawberry shortcake really is excellent; I tried the recipe that is described step by step in the game after we came home from Italy.</p>
<p>But as special and technically impressive as Bob is, the real magic of this game is the immersion in nature that it provides, which is as complete as the protagonist&#8217;s eventual immersion in the spring of its title. You start off with a book &#8212; <em>A Field Guide to the Natural History of the Mountainous Regions</em> &#8212; already in your possession. You can look up in its pages any of the flora and fauna you encounter during your hiking, to learn a bit more about it from a scientific point of view. Or you can forget about science and its facts and figures for once in your life and just take in the natural world that&#8217;s all around you.</p>
<p>The puzzles here do their job by giving structure and motivation to your wanderings. They&#8217;re fun to solve whilst being very much in tune with the pastoral atmosphere of their surroundings. There are a few jarring deaths that might have been better elided &#8212; you can get yourself gored to death by a bull moose if you aren&#8217;t careful &#8212; but those are about the only places where the author puts a foot wrong. This is a game about the quiet moments, about peace and beauty and love rather than war and strife and hatred, about the best parts of us rather than the worst. It&#8217;s a pity that it&#8217;s the only piece of interactive fiction that Brent VanFossen ever wrote. We could use a lot more games like it.</p>

<p><code>Black.<br />
White.  Cold.<br />
Dry.<br />
The sun is just about to rise on latitude 74.  In the darkness the last stars<br />
pierce the air and the arctic wind is a dying songbird.  Below the snow dunes,<br />
you are waking.  Something is wrong.</code></p>
<p><code><strong>North End</strong><br />
One by one, your senses speak to you.  There is one absolute: cold.  The<br />
hard surface you're lying on is cold, the thin gown thrown over your body is<br />
cold, the disinfectant-tinged air is cold, the darkness around you is cold.<br />
Even your mind is cold and empty.  Where are you?  Who are you?  You feel the<br />
warm edge of a memory, but it fades as you approach.  Slowly, your joints<br />
bulging with ache, you get to your feet and look around.</code></p>
<p><code>You're standing in a cold, dimly lit hall which runs south toward a feeble light and terminates at a door to the north, out of which juts a weird device. Next to the door, in the northeast corner, is a heavy bulkhead, and you can just make out a third door on the west wall.</code></p>
<p><em>Babel</em> is the first of three games that were authored between 1997 and 2000 by <a href="https://piedmontlaureate.org/past-laureates/ian-finley/">Ian Finley</a>, a professional playwright, actor, and theater instructor. As a game with points and puzzles and most of the other standard accoutrements of the traditional text adventure, it is by far the most conventional of the trio. It placed second in the 1997 IF Comp.</p>
<p><em>Babel&#8217;</em>s setting and premise verge on the clichéd. It takes place in an isolated polar research complex where Horrible Things transpire, a staple premise for science fiction and horror stretching back many, many decades. Yet the game serves as proof that execution will always trump whole-cloth invention. Few works of narrative art have done claustrophobic dread better than this one.</p>
<p>There is an interesting twist to the premise here. The Horrible Things in question have <em>already</em> happened as the game begins, when you come to consciousness shivering in the frigid air inside a complex that is now inhabited only by the corpses of your former colleagues. (Yes, an amnesic protagonist is an even more hackneyed cliché than the isolated research complex gone wrong, but remember what I said about execution.) As you begin to explore, knowledge of what happened comes back to you in the form of sudden flashes of memory that are like psychotic breaks, so jarring and traumatic are they. The sense of foreboding &#8212; of dawning knowledge that you&#8217;d prefer not to have &#8212; mounts and mounts as you solve a series of quite simple, straightforward puzzles to gain access to more and more of the complex and unlock more and more of your own unconscious. At last, it all comes to a head in a hair-raisingly twisted ending.</p>
<p><em>Babel</em> did garner some criticism in its day for taking the easy way out with its storytelling. Relying on the classic gambit of uncovering a backstory rather than participating in a full-blown drama in the here and now lets it sidestep most of the difficulties of doing elaborate plotting through the mechanisms of text and parser. Yet what another critic might call a cop-out, I call making smart use of the tools at one&#8217;s disposal; ironic though it is to say this about a medium that likes to go by the name of &#8220;interactive fiction,&#8221; novelistic storytelling isn&#8217;t what parser-driven games tend to do best. Tying <em>Babel&#8217;</em>s story so closely to exploration &#8212; something interactive fiction <em>does</em> do very well &#8212; strikes me as thoroughly sensible.</p>
<p>I certainly can&#8217;t argue with the results here. <em>Babel</em> is a masterclass in tension, dread, and atmosphere, the perfect game to play in front of the fire on some cold, dark winter night when the snow is piling up alarmingly high on the other side of the window.</p>

<h2><strong><a href="https://ifdb.org/viewgame?id=2xyccw3pe0uovfad">Spider and Web</a></strong> by Andrew Plotkin<br />

<p><code>On the whole, it was worth the trip. The plains really were broad and grain-gold, if scarred with fences and agricultural crawlers. The mountains were overwhelming. And however much of the capital city is crusted with squat brick and faceless concrete hulks, there are still flashes of its historic charm. You've seen spires above the streets -- tiny green parks below tenements -- hidden jewels of fountains beyond walls. Any bland alley can conceal balconies wrought into iron gardens, fiery mosaics, a tree or bed of flowers nurtured by who knows who.</code></p>
<p><code>This alley, however, is a total washout. It ends in flat bare dirty brick, and you've found nothing but a door which lacks even the courtesy of a handle. Maybe you should call it a day.</code></p>
<p><code><strong>End of Alley</strong><br />
It's a narrow dead end here, with walls rising oppressively high in three directions. The alley is quite empty, bare even of trash. (Your guidebook warned you: the police are as efficient about litter laws as about everything else they do.) You can retreat to the south.</code></p>
<p><code>A plain metal door faces you to the east, near the alley's end. It's firmly shut.</code></p>
<p>Following the example of Paul O&#8217;Brian, I don&#8217;t hesitate for a moment to stand <a href="https://blog.zarfhome.com/">Andrew Plotkin</a> up alongside Mike Roberts and Graham Nelson as one of the people who did the most to keep the humble text adventure alive during the 1990s and beyond. In addition to a whole raft of vital technical and administrative contributions, he has written more important and highly lauded games over a longer span of time than anyone else. Many of them are slyly subversive; he has a gift for translating the interior of his protagonists&#8217; minds into landscapes that aren&#8217;t quite what they appear to be. If I was forced to point to a weakness in his work, however, I might say that he has sometimes made his player work a little too hard for her experience, especially during the early phase of his career. A minimalist by instinct, his early games don&#8217;t exactly bend over backward to welcome the player in. &#8220;Here I am,&#8221; they seem to say. &#8220;Come inside if you like. I don&#8217;t really care one way or the other.&#8221;</p>
<p>But <em>Spider and Web</em> doesn&#8217;t have that problem, if problem it be. The deft opening above, seemingly written from the point of view of an adventurous tourist on a visit to an unnamed Eastern European country during the Cold War era, definitely has no trouble capturing my interest. Coincidentally or not, this game, which Plotkin released in February of 1998, is still regarded by many or most text-adventure aficionados as his masterpiece. I count myself among their number.</p>
<p><em>Spider and Web</em> is an exploration of the old fictional trope of the unreliable narrator, carried out in a way that would be impossible in a non-interactive medium. I can best explain some of what it&#8217;s doing by describing how its first handful of turns are likely play out for you. In the role of the tourist, you poke and fiddle with the inscrutably blank door in front of you for a while, until, seeing no way to get through it, you walk off to discover what else lies to the south. As soon as you do so, a &#8220;glaring light&#8221; appears before your eyes, and you find yourself in an interrogation chamber. &#8220;Don&#8217;t be absurd,&#8221; says your interrogator. &#8220;You&#8217;re no more a sightseer than the Old Tree in Capitol Square; and if you&#8217;d had enough sense to walk away from that door, you wouldn&#8217;t be here. You&#8217;re going to start by telling me how you got through that door.&#8221;</p>
<p>And then you&#8217;re thrown back to the start of the game. But this time the opening text is subtly different.</p>
<p><code>On the whole, it was worth the trip. The plains really were broad and grain-gold, if scarred with fences and agricultural crawlers. The mountains were overwhelming. And however much of the capital city is scarred with squat brick and faceless concrete hulks, there are still flashes of its historic charm.</code></p>

<p>From here on, you keep trying to tell your interrogator a story that minimizes your exposure as a foreign agent and saboteur, and he keeps calling you out on it, forcing you to change the details.</p>
<p>Until, that is, deep into the game, when you arrive at the moment that changes everything. People tend to refer to this moment as simply The Puzzle. It&#8217;s not an enormously difficult puzzle, but it&#8217;s nonetheless been called, with no hyperbole whatsoever, the <em>best</em> text-adventure puzzle of all time, all of the games of Infocom included. It&#8217;s far too brilliant to spoil here, but suffice to say that, when the light bulb does goes off in your head and you feverishly type the necessary command and see that you were <em>right</em>, you&#8217;ll be jumping out of your chair and pumping your fist as if you&#8217;ve just defeated the last boss in <em>Dark Souls</em>. The roles of the spider and the insect trapped in its web will have reversed themselves, and it will feel <em>amazing</em>.</p>
<p>After that, <em>Spider and Web</em> is just a chase scene, albeit a very well-executed one. But my, what a genius conceit comes before it, and what a genius puzzle to bring the conceit to its perfect fruition. Epistemology was never so much fun.</p>

<p><code><strong>November, 1997.</strong></code></p>
<p><code>You take a deep breath of salty air as the first raindrops begin to spatter the pavement, and the swollen, slate-colored clouds that blanket the sky mutter ominous portents amongst themselves over the little coastal town of Anchorhead.</code></p>
<p><code>Squinting up into the glowering storm, you wonder how everything managed to happen so fast. The strange phone call over a month ago, from a lawyer claiming to represent the estate of some distant branch of Michael's family, was bewildering enough in itself... but then the sudden whirlwind of planning and decisions, legal details and travel arrangements, the packing up and shipping away of your entire home, your entire life...</code></p>
<p><code>Now suddenly here you are, after driving for the past two days straight, over a thousand miles away from the familiar warmth of Texas, getting ready to move into the ancestral mansion of a clan of relatives so far removed that not even Michael has ever heard of them. And you've only been married since June and none of this was any of your idea in the first place, and already it's starting to rain.</code></p>
<p><code>These days, you often find yourself feeling confused and uprooted.</code></p>
<p><code>You shake yourself and force the melancholy thoughts from your head, trying to focus on the errand at hand. You're to meet with the real estate agent and pick up the keys to your new house while Michael runs across town to take care of some paperwork at the university. He'll be back to pick you up in a few minutes, and then the two of you can begin the long, precarious process of settling in.</code></p>
<p><code>A sullen belch emanates from the clouds, and the rain starts coming down harder -- fat, cold drops smacking loudly against the cobblestones. Shouldn't it be snowing in New England at this time of year? With a sigh, you open your umbrella.</code></p>
<p><code><strong>Outside the Real Estate Office</strong><br />
A grim little cul-de-sac, tucked away in a corner of the claustrophobic tangle of narrow, twisting avenues that largely constitute the older portion of Anchorhead. Like most of the streets in this city, it is ancient, shadowy, and leads essentially nowhere. The lane ends here at the real estate agent's office, which lies to the east, and winds its way back toward the center of town to the west. A narrow, garbage-choked alley opens to the southeast.</code></p>
<p>&#8220;Anyone who had ever read anything by <a href="/2015/09/the-campy-cosmic-horror-of-h-p-lovecraft">H.P. Lovecraft</a>, or even stood downwind of someone who has, will immediately recognize his influence throughout this game,&#8221; writes Michael Gentry in his introductory notes for <em>Anchorhead</em>. And indeed, this sprawling game, which Gentry released in May of 1998, is to my mind <em>the</em> definitive work of digital Lovecraftia, easily outdoing the likes of <a href="/2015/10/the-lurking-horror"><em>The Lurking Horror</em></a> and <a href="/2019/08/alone-in-the-dark"><em>Alone in the Dark</em></a>.</p>
<p>Like all of the best Lovecraft homages, <em>Anchorhead</em> succeeds by embracing the best parts of its inspiration and binning the worst. Our protagonist here is a strong, capable woman, something that was well beyond the most fevered imaginings of old Howard himself. Along with the rampant misogyny, gone too is the almost unbelievably virulent racism that is at the core of so much of the man&#8217;s output. And I&#8217;m almost equally happy to be able to say that Gentry is adept at capturing the flavor of Lovecraft&#8217;s prose without descending into the pseudo-eighteenth-century word salads for which his inspiration is so famous. Yet the horror at the heart of <em>Anchorhead</em> is the same existential dread, the same indelible product of the modern secular condition onto which Lovecraft stumbled. It isn&#8217;t the horror of malevolent godlike entities; it is the horror of godlike entities who care about human beings no more than we care about the ants we trample underfoot.</p>
<p>You play a young wife, married less than half a year, whose husband, a soft-spoken professor of history, has just received an unexpected inheritance from relatives he never knew he had in the New England harbor town of Anchorhead. So, the two of you have upped stakes to move halfway across the country, into a palatial if rather sinister-looking abode at the edge of town. But now your husband is starting to behave strangely, almost as if he&#8217;s fallen under some sort of spell.</p>
<p>The core of this game&#8217;s strange allure is the downtrodden town of Anchorhead itself. As you play, you can see its sad gray walls and cobblestones under its sad gray skies; hear the forlorn cawing of seagulls and the background hum of the waves; feel cold rain on your hair and wet moss on your hands; taste the sour sea breeze; smell the stale tobacco of the sulky old men who spend their days drinking up the gloom in the world&#8217;s least cozy tavern. Few places in interactive fiction have ever been as thoroughly realized as this one. It&#8217;s deliciously repulsive.</p>
<p>Add onto this geographical framework the plot, which is the definition of a slow burn. You spend the first half or more of the game mainly conducting research, uncovering more and more ominous details about your husband&#8217;s cursed heritage. Finally, your mounting forebodings explode into some frantic scenes of terror. Even in the game&#8217;s latter half, however, Gentry understands that effective horror is a matter of tension and release. He knows when to pour it on and when to ease the pressure, to let you catch your breath and recover your frazzled wits before your next peek into the abyss.</p>
<p><em>Anchorhead</em> does a superb job of integrating its puzzles, if that&#8217;s what we wish to call them, into this vivid setting and unfolding plot. They&#8217;re never arbitrary, but consistently driven by your need to find out more. Then, once you&#8217;ve found out all too much, you have to find a way to survive the forces unleashed against you, to save your husband from a fate worse than death, and possibly to save the entire planet while you&#8217;re at it. If you read through the fruits of your research carefully and do the thing that seems most logical in some admittedly awful circumstances, you&#8217;ll find that that thing generally works about as well as can be expected.</p>
<p>Play it, live it, and learn to love its eldritch blasphemies. Scary text adventures &#8212; heck, ludic horror in general &#8212; simply don&#8217;t get any better than <em>Anchorhead</em>, folks.</p>
<p><em>(Do note that, in addition to the free version from 1998, Michael Gentry made available <a href="https://mikegentry5.itch.io/anchorhead">an enhanced twentieth-anniversary edition of this landmark game in 2018</a>, with additional scenes, puzzles, and details, plus 50 illustrations to accompany the text. He&#8217;s also tinkered with the design to remove some unwinnable situations and added some features to make the game more newbie friendly in general. I haven&#8217;t played this version yet, but I have no reason to doubt that it makes a great game even better. If I was playing Anchorhead for the first time, this is definitely the version I&#8217;d go for. The price of $10 is very reasonable for a game of this size and scope.)</em></p>

<p><code>You're just starting to doze off when a jerking motion brings you back to<br />
alertness.  You look over to see your boss, Mr. Teeterwaller, struggling to<br />
steer the car onto the shoulder as the engine dies.  You can see that all of<br />
the dashboard lights are on as the car jerks to a stop.</code><br />
<code><br />
This is turning into a fine business trip.  First Mr. Teeterwaller insists on<br />
making the five-hour car trip in the middle of the night so the company won't<br />
have to pay for a hotel, then you spend an hour stuck behind a convoy of slow<br />
trucks on Teeterwaller's two-lane supposed short-cut, and now his aging<br />
bargain-basement car strands you out in the middle of nowhere.</code></p>
<p><code>Teeterwaller turns off the headlights and turns on the hazard lights.  "I just had this thing in the shop," he mumbles.</code></p>
<p><code><strong>In the car</strong><br />
The Toyunchknisk Piglet was imported from Blottnya during the brief period<br />
between the fall of the old iron-fisted regime and the ethnic unrest that<br />
divided the tiny country into several even tinier countries whose names you<br />
can't recall, since the press lost interest several years ago.  The car is<br />
almost comically spartan, so it's just like your boss to own one.  The only<br />
amenity the dashboard offers is a glove compartment; no radio, no air<br />
conditioner, no console armrest, no cup-holders.</code></p>
<p><code>You're sitting in the rather uncomfortable passenger's seat.  The driver's door is closed, and your door is closed.</code></p>
<p><code>Sitting on the back seat is a jacket, a map, a Project Tyche manual, and a magazine.  The ignition seems to contain a car key.</code></p>
<p><code>Your boss Mr. Teeterwaller is here.</code></p>
<p><code>You're carrying your temporary ID card.</code></p>
<p>Mike Roberts&#8217;s <em>The Plant</em>, which took third place in the 1998 IF Competition in spite of a considerable number of complaints that it was &#8220;too big for the Comp,&#8221; is in some ways the most old-school game in this roundup, a sturdy puzzlefest without any overt agenda beyond that of entertaining you. In another sense, though, it&#8217;s the most inextricably bound to the late 1990s. For it positively radiates the influence of <a href="/2024/09/the-truth-is-out-there-part-1-the-will-to-believe"><em>The X-Files</em></a>, which was right at the zenith of its popularity at the time this game was released. In terms of plot and setting, <em>The Plant</em> plays like one of the show&#8217;s more comedic, postmodern episodes &#8212; perhaps one of those written by Darin Morgan or Vince Gilligan, the sort where you never quite know where earnestness ends and satire begins.</p>
<p>The plant of the title isn&#8217;t the kind that grows in dirt, but rather a strange factory complex that you stumble upon on a road trip with your boss, the skinflint Mr. Teeterwaller, in the latter&#8217;s Toyunchknisk Piglet, a car which makes a Yugo seem like a Mercedes. The tropes of 1990s conspiracy culture are rolled out one by one: desolate desert highways, convoys of unmarked trucks driving through the dead of night carrying who knows what, anonymous men in black, impossible technologies that seem unlikely to be of terrestrial origin, riddles piled upon mysteries piled upon enigmas. A ufologist magazine you find, demanding &#8220;an investigation into a previous investigation of an alleged coverup,&#8221; might easily have been found in the <em>X-Files</em> episode <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0751147">&#8220;Jose Chung&#8217;s <em>From Outer Space</em>.&#8221;</a></p>
<p>It&#8217;s all fodder for a well-crafted, good-natured, slightly goofy text adventure of the sort at which Mike Roberts excels. There are a lot of really enjoyable puzzles here, not too hard but not too trivial either, and always meticulously fair. <em>The Plant</em> breaks no new ground whatsoever, but it does provide a rollicking good time from start to finish. Its secret weapon is Mr. Teeterwaller, who follows you around over dune and dale, up ladders and elevators and scaffolds, mumbling and fretting all the while but never abandoning you. He seems useless &#8212; until suddenly he isn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://inventory.superverbose.com/2020/08/06/the-plant-by-michael-j-roberts-comp98/">his review of <em>The Plant</em></a>, Paul O&#8217;Brian recommended it most of all to those who were &#8220;a little impatient with all the growing that the medium of interactive fiction is doing, and long for a good old-fashioned Infocom-style thrill ride.&#8221; Although O&#8217;Brian&#8217;s overall review is very positive, that sentence is too dismissive by half; the sort of game we have here is exactly the one that the medium of text and parser was invented to provide, and is still the one for which it is most intrinsically suited. <em>The Plant&#8217;</em>s stolid old-school approach has aged better than that of many of the games that once thought they represented the future of the medium.</p>

<p><code><strong>Speeding down Montgomery Boulevard</strong><br />
The streetlights are bright. Unbearably bright. You have to squint as hard as you can to keep your retinas from bursting into flame.</code></p>
<p><code>"Welcome back to the land of the LIVING, bud," Rob says. "You planning to stick around for a while or you gonna pass out again? Cause one thing I've learned about chicks is that they actually DON'T LIKE IT when you pass out on them in the middle of gettin' it on. You hear me? So if that's, like, your PLAN, then I'm droppin' you off and showin' up solo."</code></p>
<p><code>You don't exactly remember where the day went, but as you listen to Rob rant on, bits of it start to float back to you: a day on the slopes, the brisk February wind against your face; polishing off a keg back at the lodge; those two girls you and Rob had hit it off with, the ones who'd given you their address in town. "We all should get together sometime!" they'd said. Of course, Rob insisted that by "sometime" they'd meant "later tonight." You hadn't been so sure, but then you'd blacked out before you could argue the point.</code></p>
<p><code>How Rob came to be driving your car you're not exactly sure. Apparently he couldn't wait till you were sober enough to drive it yourself. From the way he's weaving all over the road, he also apparently couldn't wait till HE was sober enough to drive it, either.</code></p>
<p><code>Rob checks himself out in the rearview mirror. "Man, I am one handsome dude," he says approvingly.</code></p>
<p>And so we come to the smallest game on this list, which is nevertheless The Big One of 1998, even more so than <em>Spider and Web</em> or <em>Anchorhead</em>. In fact, Adam Cadre&#8217;s <em>Photopia</em> is without a doubt the best-known and most-played parser-based interactive fiction of the entire post-Infocom era. The winner of the 1998 IF Comp, it has today twice as many ratings as any other game on The Interactive Fiction Database, and has been written up countless times in magazines and websites that normally don&#8217;t cover this sort of thing. Thousands upon thousands of people over the years have found it a profoundly moving work of literature. I would never presume to tell these people that they&#8217;re wrong to feel as they do. Yet I do have to say that I&#8217;m somewhat less smitten.</p>
<p><em>Photopia</em> is about a teenage girl named Alley, but you never inhabit her directly. Instead you see her from the perspectives of other people in her life. You spend the most time as Wendy, a much younger girl whom she babysits. The two make up stories together in which Wendy is an astronaut or an undersea explorer. As they do so, Alley effectively becomes the computer game with which you are interacting, a gimmick which hearkens to <a href="/2011/05/will-crowthers-adventure-part-1">the text adventure&#8217;s origins</a> in the shared story spaces of <a href="/2011/07/dungeons-and-dragons">tabletop <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em></a>. &#8220;Read you a story?&#8221; asks Alley of her charge. &#8220;What fun would that be? I&#8217;ve got a better idea: let&#8217;s tell a story together.&#8221;</p>
<p>But there are also vignettes from the real world, in which you see Alley through the eyes of her mother, her father, and the boy at school who has a crush on her. Most searingly, you briefly inhabit Wendy&#8217;s father, who is driving Alley home from her babysitting gig when his car gets side-swiped by a drunk driver, killing his young passenger instantly.</p>
<p><em>Photopia</em> is almost completely puzzle-less. That said, the one interaction that might be construed as a puzzle is the most transcendent moment in the game. As with The Puzzle in <em>Spider and Web</em>, the solution to this one comes in a dazzling rush of insight. It serves as the ideal therapy for anyone who&#8217;s tired to death of the boring, drop-em-and-map-em mazes that are found in so many old-school text adventures. To say any more would be to spoil another of the most magical moments in all of interactive fiction.</p>
<p>Otherwise, though, <em>Photopia</em> falls a little flat for me, no matter how hard I try to love it like so many other people do. Its one amazing puzzle and the meta-textual cleverness of the story you and Alley tell together can&#8217;t overcome the emotional immaturity of the fiction as a whole. This is the poison pill that comes with taking text adventures up-market. When you invite me to consider your piece as a game, I compare it with other games; when you invite me to consider it as deathless fiction, I start to compare it with <em>truly</em> deathless fictions.</p>
<p>At bottom, Alley is as much a male-adolescent fantasy as <a href="/2023/06/tomb-raider">Lara Croft</a>. She&#8217;s a nerd-friendly version of a Manic Pixie Dream Girl: &#8220;She&#8217;s beautiful and nice and she likes science!&#8221; We never learn a single bad or even ambivalent thing about her. She&#8217;s sweet and loving to her parents, the kind of girl who likes to do science projects in the garage and lie on a blanket at night beside her father cataloging the stars overhead. She navigates the savage politics of high school with preternatural aplomb, being friends with all and cruel to none. And, as we&#8217;ve seen, she&#8217;s never too tired or distracted to spin endlessly imaginative yarns for the little girl she babysits. Simply put, she&#8217;s too perfect to be real. Has she no discontents at all? Is she never in a bad mood? Has she any inner life at all? To mow down this Hallmark movie version of a teenage girl with a drunk driver at the end smacks more of bathos than pathos.</p>
<p>Adam Cadre was a very young man when he wrote <em>Photopia</em>. I fancy that it shows. Tellingly, the most successful part of the story is the one written from the point of view of a character who is, I suspect, the closest to the author himself: the boy in Alley&#8217;s school who&#8217;s crazy about her. I can remember seeing the girls I crushed on when I was his age in just the way he does: as magical creatures, as far above the mundane day-to-day of life as the angels painted on the ceiling of a cathedral. What I didn&#8217;t understand back then was that, in insisting on seeing them this way, I was refusing to see them as fully actualized flesh-and-blood human beings just like me. I don&#8217;t get the feeling that Cadre fully understood this yet at the time he wrote <em>Photopia</em>.</p>
<p>Still, stickily sentimental though I find <em>Photopia</em> to be, by no means do I want to discourage you from playing it. Even if you come away seeing it as a snapshot of a certain stage in male rather than female adolescence, as I tend to do, that too has a resonance all its own. (Ah, to be sixteen again&#8230; an age at which I would probably have <em>adored</em> this game, had it existed then.) Then, too, there&#8217;s no denying <em>Photopia&#8217;</em>s importance to the history of its medium. And it has the virtue of being short, with that one magical moment that&#8217;s well worth investing an hour of your life to experience. As for the rest of it&#8230; who knows? You might find that you unabashedly love it. Plenty of people whose opinions are every bit as valid as mine do.</p>

<p><code> </code></p>
<p>One day in June of 1995, Tim Schafer came to work at LucasArts and realized that, for the first time in a long time, he didn&#8217;t have anything pressing to do. <a href="/2021/07/full-throttle"><em>Full Throttle</em></a>, his biker movie of an adventure game, had been released several weeks before. Now, all of the initial crush of interviews and marketing logistics was behind him. A mountain had been climbed. So, as game designers do, he started to think about what his next Everest should be.</p>
<p>Schafer has told in some detail how he came up with the core ideas behind <em>Grim Fandango</em> over the course of that summer of 1995.</p>
<blockquote><p>The truth is, I had part of the Fandango idea before I did Full Throttle. I wanted to do a game that would feature those little papier-mâché folk-art skeletons from Mexico. I was looking at their simple shapes and how the bones were just painted on the outside, and I thought, &#8220;Texture maps! 3D! The bones will be on the outside! It&#8217;ll look cool!&#8221;</p>
<p>But then I was stuck. I had these skeletons walking around the Land of the Dead. So what? What did they do? Where were they going? What did they want? Who&#8217;s the main character? Who&#8217;s the villain? The mythology said that the dead walk the dark plane of the underworld known as Mictlān for four years, after which their souls arrive at the ninth plane, the land of eternal rest. Sounds pretty &#8220;questy&#8221; to me. There you have it: a game.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not cool enough,&#8221; said Peter Tscale, my lead artist. &#8220;A guy walking in a supernatural world? What&#8217;s he doing? Supernatural things? It just sounds boring to me.&#8221;</p>
<p>So, I revamped the story. Adventure games are all fantasies really, so I had to ask myself, &#8220;Who would people want to be in a game? What would people want to do?&#8221; And in the Land of the Dead, who would people rather be than Death himself? Being the Grim Reaper is just as cool as being a biker, I decided. And what does the Grim Reaper do? He picks up people who have died and carts them over from the other world. Just like a driver of a taxi or limo.</p>
<p>Okay, so that&#8217;s Manny Calavera, our main character. But who&#8217;s the bad guy? What&#8217;s the plot? I had just seen <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0071315">Chinatown</a>, and I really liked the whole water-supply/real-estate scam that Noah Cross had going there, so of course I tried to rip that off and have Manny be a real-estate salesman who got caught up in a real-estate scandal. Then he was just like the guys in <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0104348/">Glengarry Glen Ross</a>, always looking for the good leads. But why would Hector Lemans, my villain, want real estate? Why would anyone? They&#8217;re dead! They&#8217;re only souls. What do souls in the Land of the Dead want?</p>
<p>They want to get out! They want safe passage out, just like in <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0034583/">Casablanca</a>! The Land of the Dead is a transitory place, and everybody&#8217;s waiting around for their travel papers. So Manny is a travel agent, selling tickets on the big train out of town, and Hector&#8217;s stealing the tickets&#8230;</p></blockquote>

<p>This, then, became the elevator pitch for <em>Grim Fandango</em>. Begin with the rich folklore surrounding Mexico&#8217;s Day of the Dead, a holiday celebrated each year just after Halloween, which combines European Christian myths about death and the afterlife with the older, indigenous ones that still haunt the Aztec ruins of Teopanzolco. Then combine it with classic film noir to wind up with Raymond Chandler in a Latino afterlife. It was nothing if not a strikingly original idea for an adventure game. But there was also one more, almost equally original part of it: to do it in 3D.</p>
<p>To hear Tim Schafer tell the story, the move away from LucasArts&#8217;s traditional pixel art and into the realm of points, polygons, and textures was motivated by his desire to deliver a more cinematic experience. By no means does this claim lack credibility; as you can gather by reading what he wrote above, Schafer was and is a passionate film buff, who tends to resort to talking in movie titles when other forms of communication fail him. The environments in previous LucasArts adventure games &#8212; even the self-consciously cinematic <em>Full Throttle</em> &#8212; could only be shown from the angle the pixel artists had chosen to drawn them from. In this sense, they were like a theatrical play, or a <em>really</em> old movie, from the time before Orson Welles emancipated his camera and let it begin to roam freely through his sets in <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0033467/"><em>Citizen Kane</em></a>. By using 3D, Schafer could become the Orson Welles of adventure games; he would be able to deliver dramatic angles and closeups as the player&#8217;s avatar moved about, would be able to put the player <em>in</em> his world rather than forever forcing her to look down on it from on-high. This is the story he still tells today, and there&#8217;s no reason to believe it isn&#8217;t true enough, as far as it goes.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, it&#8217;s only half of the full story. The other half is a messier, less idealistic tale of process and practical economics.</p>
<p>Reckoned in their cost of production per hour of play time delivered, adventure games stood apart from any other genre in their industry, and not in a good way. Building games entirely out of bespoke, single-use puzzles and assets was <em>expensive</em> in contrast to the more process-intensive genres. As time went on and gamers demanded ever bigger, prettier adventures, in higher resolutions with more colors, this became more and more of a problem. Already in 1995, when adventure games were still selling very well, the production costs that were seemingly inherent to the genre were a cause for concern. And the following year, when the genre <a href="/2022/06/toonstruck-or-a-case-study-in-the-death-of-adventure-games">failed to produce</a> a single million-plus-selling breakout hit for the first time in half a decade, they began to look like an existential threat. At that point, LucasArts&#8217;s decision to address the issue proactively in <em>Grim Fandango </em>by switching from pixel art to 3D suddenly seemed a very wise move indeed. For a handful of Silicon Graphics workstations running 3D-modelling software could churn out images far more quickly than an army of pixel artists, at a fraction of the cost per image. If the graphics that resulted lacked some of the quirky, hand-drawn, cartoon-like personality that had marked LucasArts&#8217;s earlier adventure games, they made up for that by virtue of their flexibility: a scene could be shown from a different angle just by changing a few parameters instead of having to redraw it from scratch. This really did raise the prospect of making the more immersive games that Tim Schafer desired. But from a bean counter&#8217;s point of view, the best thing about it was the cost savings.</p>
<p>And there was one more advantage as well, one that began to seem ever more important as time went on and the market for adventure games running on personal computers continued to soften. Immersive 3D was more or less the default setting of the Sony PlayStation, which had <a href="/2023/12/putting-the-j-in-the-rpg-part-2-playstation-for-the-win">come roaring out of Japan</a> in 1995 to seize the title of the most successful games console of the twentieth century just before the curtain fell on that epoch. In addition to its 3D hardware, the PlayStation sported a CD drive, memory cards for saving state, and a slightly older typical user than the likes of Nintendo and Sega. And yet, although a number of publishers ported their 2D computer-born adventure games to the PlayStation, they never felt entirely at home there, having been designed for a mouse rather than a game controller.<span class="footnote_referrer"><a role="button" tabindex="0" onclick="footnote_moveToReference_6147_10('footnote_plugin_reference_6147_10_1');" onkeypress="footnote_moveToReference_6147_10('footnote_plugin_reference_6147_10_1');" ><sup id="footnote_plugin_tooltip_6147_10_1" class="footnote_plugin_tooltip_text">[1]</sup></a><span id="footnote_plugin_tooltip_text_6147_10_1" class="footnote_tooltip">A mouse was available as an accessory for the PlayStation, but it was never very popular.</span></span><script type="text/javascript"> jQuery('#footnote_plugin_tooltip_6147_10_1').tooltip({ tip: '#footnote_plugin_tooltip_text_6147_10_1', tipClass: 'footnote_tooltip', effect: 'fade', predelay: 0, fadeInSpeed: 200, delay: 400, fadeOutSpeed: 200, position: 'bottom center', relative: true, offset: [-7, 100], });</script> A 3D adventure game with a controller-friendly interface might be a very different proposition. If it played its cards right, it would open the door to an installed base of customers five to ten times the size of the extant market for games on personal computers.</p>
<div id="attachment_6149" style="width: 610px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://www.filfre.net/2024/11/grim-fandango/manny/" rel="attachment wp-att-6149"><img decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-6149" class="wp-image-6149" src="https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/manny-300x225.png" alt="" width="600" height="450" srcset="https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/manny-300x225.png 300w, https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/manny.png 640w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-6149" class="wp-caption-text">Working with 3D graphics in the late 1990s required some clever sleight of hand if they weren&#8217;t to end up looking terrible. <em>Grim Fandango&#8217;</em>s masterstroke was to make all of its characters &#8212; like the protagonist Manny Calavera, whom you see above &#8212; mere skeletons, whose faces are literally painted onto their skulls. (The characters are shown to speak by manipulating the <a href="/2019/01/life-off-the-grid-part-1-making-ultima-underworld">texture maps</a> that represent their faces, not by manipulating the underlying 3D models themselves.) This approach gave the game a look reminiscent of another of its cinematic inspirations, Tim Burton&#8217;s <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0107688/"><em>The Nightmare Before Christmas</em></a>, whilst conveniently avoiding all of the complications of trying to render pliant flesh. A win-win, as they say. Or, as Tim Schafer said: &#8220;Instead of fighting the tech limitations of 3D, you have to embrace them and turn them into a style.&#8221;</p></div>
<p>But I&#8217;m afraid I&#8217;ve gotten slightly ahead of myself. This constellation of ideas, affordances, problems, and solutions was still in a nascent form in November of 1995, when LucasArts hired a young programmer fresh out of university by the name of Bret Mogilefsky. Mogilefsky was a known quantity already, having worked at LucasArts as a tester on and off while he was earning his high-school and university diplomas. Now, he was entrusted with the far more high-profile task of making SCUMM, LucasArts&#8217;s venerable adventure engine, safe for 3D.</p>
<p>After struggling for a few months, he concluded that this latest paradigm shift was just too extreme for an engine that had been <a href="/2015/07/a-new-force-in-games-part-3-scumm">created on a Commodore 64</a> circa 1986 and ported and patched from there. He would have to tear SCUMM down so far in order to add 3D functionality that it would be easier and cleaner simply to make a new engine from scratch. He told his superiors this, and they gave him permission to do so &#8212; albeit suspecting all the while, Mogilefsky is convinced, that he would eventually realize that game engines are easier envisioned than implemented and come crawling back to SCUMM. By no means was he the first bright spark at LucasArts who thought he could reinvent the adventuring wheel.</p>
<p>But he did prove the first one to call his bosses&#8217; bluff. The engine that he called GrimE (&#8220;<em>Grim</em> Engine,&#8221; but pronounced like the synonym for &#8220;dirt&#8221;) used a mixture of pre-rendered and real-time-rendered 3D. The sets in which Manny and his friends and enemies played out their dramas would be the former; the aforementioned actors themselves would be the latter. GrimE was a piebald beast in another sense as well: that of cheerfully appropriating whatever useful code Mogilefsky happened to find lying around the house at LucasArts, most notably from the first-person shooter <a href="/2024/04/jedi-knight-plus-notes-on-an-expanded-universe"><em>Jedi Knight</em></a>.</p>
<p>Like SCUMM before it, GrimE provided relatively non-technical designers like Tim Schafer with a high-level scripting language that they could use themselves to code all of the mechanics of plot and puzzles. Mogilefsky adapted for this task Lua, a new, still fairly obscure programming language out of Brazil. It was an inspired choice. Elegant, learnable, and yet infinitely and easily extendible, Lua has gone on to become a staple language of modern game development, to be found today in such places as the wildly popular Roblox platform.</p>
<p>The most frustrating aspects of GrimE from a development perspective all clustered around the spots where its two approaches to 3D graphics rubbed against one another, producing a good deal of friction in the process. If, for example, Manny was to drink a glass of whiskey, the pre-rendered version of the glass that was part of the background set had to be artfully swapped with its real-time-rendered incarnation as soon as Manny began to interact with it. Getting such actions to look seamless absorbed vastly more time and energy than anyone had expected it to.</p>
<p>In fact, if the bean counters had been asked to pass judgment, they would have had a hard time labeling GrimE a success at all under their metrics. <em>Grim Fandango</em> was in active development for almost three full years, and may have ended up costing as much as $3 million. This was at least two and a half times as much as <em>Full Throttle</em> had cost, and placed it in the same ballpark as <a href="/2024/04/the-curse-of-monkey-island"><em>The Curse of Monkey Island</em></a>, LucasArts&#8217;s last and most audiovisually lavish SCUMM adventure, which was released a year before <em>Grim Fandango</em>. Further, despite employing a distinctly console-like control scheme in lieu of pointing and clicking with the mouse, <em>Grim Fandango</em> would never make it to the PlayStation; GrimE ended up being just too demanding to be made to work on such limited hardware.<span class="footnote_referrer"><a role="button" tabindex="0" onclick="footnote_moveToReference_6147_10('footnote_plugin_reference_6147_10_2');" onkeypress="footnote_moveToReference_6147_10('footnote_plugin_reference_6147_10_2');" ><sup id="footnote_plugin_tooltip_6147_10_2" class="footnote_plugin_tooltip_text">[2]</sup></a><span id="footnote_plugin_tooltip_text_6147_10_2" class="footnote_tooltip"><em>Escape from Monkey Island</em>, the only other game ever made using GrimE, was ported to the more capable PlayStation 2 in 2001.</span></span><script type="text/javascript"> jQuery('#footnote_plugin_tooltip_6147_10_2').tooltip({ tip: '#footnote_plugin_tooltip_text_6147_10_2', tipClass: 'footnote_tooltip', effect: 'fade', predelay: 0, fadeInSpeed: 200, delay: 400, fadeOutSpeed: 200, position: 'bottom center', relative: true, offset: [-7, 100], });</script></p>
<p>All that aside, though, the new engine remained an impressive technical feat, and did succeed in realizing most of Tim Schafer&#8217;s aesthetic goals for it. Even the cost savings it apparently failed to deliver come with some mitigating factors. Making the first game with a new engine is always more expensive than making the ones that follow; there was no reason to conclude that GrimE couldn&#8217;t deliver real cost savings on LucasArts&#8217;s <em>next</em> adventure game. Then, too, for all that <em>Grim Fandango</em> wound up costing two and a half times as much as <em>Full Throttle</em>, it was also well over two and a half times as long as that game.</p>
<p>&#8220;Game production schedules are like flying jumbo jets,&#8221; says Tim Schafer. &#8220;It&#8217;s very intense at the takeoff and landing, but in the middle there&#8217;s this long lull.&#8221; The landing is the time of crunch, of course, and the crunch on <em>Grim Fandango</em> was protracted and brutal even by the industry&#8217;s usual standards, stretching out for months and months of sixteen- and eighteen-hour days. For by the beginning of 1998, the game was way behind schedule and way over budget, facing a marketplace that was growing more and more unkind to the adventure genre in general. This was not a combination to instill patience in the LucasArts executive suite. Schafer&#8217;s team did get the game done by the autumn of 1998, as they had been ordered to do in no uncertain terms, but only at a huge cost to their psychological and even physical health.</p>
<p>Bret Mogilefsky remembers coming to Schafer at one point to tell him that he just didn&#8217;t think he could go on like this, that he simply had to have a break. He was met with no sympathy whatsoever. To be fair, he probably shouldn&#8217;t have expected any. Crunch was considered par for the course in the industry during this era, and LucasArts was among the worst of its practitioners. Long hours spent toiling for ridiculously low wages &#8212; Mogilefsky was hired to be the key technical cog in this multi-million-dollar project for a salary of about $30,000 per year &#8212; were considered the price you paid for the privilege of working at The <em>Star Wars</em> Company.</p>
<p>Even setting aside the personal toll it took on the people who worked there, crunch did nothing positive for the games themselves. As we&#8217;ll see, <em>Grim Fandango</em> shows the scars of crunch most obviously in its dodgy puzzle design. Good puzzles result from a methodical, iterative process of testing and carefully considering the resulting feedback. <em>Grim Fandango</em> did not benefit from such a process, and this lack is all too plainly evident.</p>
<p>But before I continue making some of you very, very mad at me, let me take some time to note the strengths of <em>Grim Fandango</em>, which are every bit as real as its weaknesses. Indeed, if I squint just right, so that my eyes <em>only</em> take in its strengths, I have no problem understanding why it&#8217;s to be found on so many lists of &#8220;The Best Adventure Games Ever,&#8221; sometimes even at the very top.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s no denying the stuff that <em>Grim Fandango</em> does well. Its visual aesthetic, which I can best describe as 1930s Art Deco meets Mexican folk art meets 1940s gangster flick, is unforgettable. And it&#8217;s married to a script that positively crackles with wit and pathos. Our hero Manny is the rare adventure-game character who can be said to go through an actual character arc, who grows and evolves over the course of his story. The driving force behind the plot is his love for a woman named Meche. But his love isn&#8217;t the puppy love that Guybrush Threepwood has for Elaine in the <a href="/2017/03/monkey-island-or-how-ron-gilbert-made-an-adventure-game-that-didnt-suck"><em>Monkey Island</em></a> games; the relationship is more nuanced, more adult, more <em>complicated</em>, and its ultimate resolution is all the more moving for that.</p>

The Land of the Death&#8217;s equivalent of death is &#8220;sprouting,&#8221; in which a character is turned into a bunch of flowers and forced to live another life in that form. Why shouldn&#8217;t the dead fear life as much as the living fear death?</p></div>
<p>Tim Schafer did not grow up with the Latino traditions that are such an inextricable part of <em>Grim Fandango</em>. Yet the game never feels like the exercise in clueless or condescending cultural tourism it might easily have become. On the contrary, the setting feels full-bodied, lived-in, natural. The cause is greatly aided by a stellar cast of voice actors with just the right accents. The Hollywood veteran Tony Plana, who plays Manny, is particularly good, teasing out exactly the right blend of world-weary cynicism and tarnished romanticism. And Maria Canalas, who plays Meche, is equally perfect in her role. The non-verbal soundtrack by Peter McConnell is likewise superb, a mixture of mariachi music and cool jazz that shouldn&#8217;t work but does. Sometimes it soars to the forefront, but more often it tinkles away in the background, setting the mood. You&#8217;d only notice it if it was gone &#8212; but trust me, then you would <em>really</em> notice.</p>
<p>This is a <em>big</em> game as well as a striking and stylish one &#8212; in fact, by most reckonings the biggest adventure that LucasArts ever made. Each of its four acts, which neatly correspond to the four years that the average soul must spend wandering the underworld before going to his or her final rest, is almost big enough to be a self-contained game in its own right. Over the course of <em>Grim Fandango</em>, Manny goes from being a down-on-his-luck Grim Reaper cum travel agent to a nightlife impresario, from the captain of an ocean liner to a prisoner laboring in an underwater mine. The story does arguably peak too early; the second act, an extended homage to <em>Casablanca</em> with Manny in the role of Humphrey Bogart, is so beautifully realized that much of what follows is slightly diminished by the comparison. Be that as it may, though, it doesn&#8217;t mean any of what follows is bad.</p>
<div id="attachment_6155" style="width: 610px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://www.filfre.net/2024/11/grim-fandango/rubacava/" rel="attachment wp-att-6155"><img decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-6155" class="wp-image-6155" src="https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/rubacava-300x225.png" alt="" width="600" height="450" srcset="https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/rubacava-300x225.png 300w, https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/rubacava.png 640w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-6155" class="wp-caption-text">The jump cut to Manny&#8217;s new life as a bar owner in the port city of Rubacava at the beginning of the second act is to my mind the most breathtaking moment of the game, the one where you first realize how expansive its scope and ambition really are.</p></div>
<p>All told, then, I have no real beef with anyone who chooses to label <em>Grim Fandango</em> an aesthetic masterpiece. If there was an annual award for style in adventure games, this game would have won it easily in 1998, just as Tim Schafer&#8217;s <em>Full Throttle</em> would have taken the prize for 1995. Sadly, though, it seems to me that the weaknesses of both games are also the same. In both of their cases, once I move beyond the aesthetics and the storytelling and turn to the gameplay, some of the air starts to leak out of the balloon.</p>
<p>The interactive aspects of <em>Grim Fandango</em> &#8212; you know, all that stuff that actually makes it a game &#8212; are dogged by two overarching sets of problems. The first is all too typical for the adventure genre: overly convoluted, often nonsensical puzzle design. Tim Schafer was always more intrinsically interested in the worlds, characters, and stories he dreamed up than he was in puzzles. This is fair enough on the face of it; he is very, very good at those things, after all. But it does mean that he needs a capable support network to ensure that his games play as well as they look and read. He had that support for 1993&#8217;s <a href="/2019/06/day-of-the-tentacle"><em>Day of the Tentacle</em></a>, largely in the person of his co-designer Dave Grossman; the result was one of the best adventure games LucasArts ever made, a perfect combination of inspired fiction with an equally inspired puzzle framework. Unfortunately, he was left to make <em>Full Throttle</em> on his own, and it showed. Ditto <em>Grim Fandango</em>. For all that he loved movies, the auteur model was not a great fit for Tim Schafer the game designer.</p>
<p><em>Grim Fandango</em> seldom gives you a clear idea of what it is you&#8217;re even trying to accomplish. Compare this with <em>The Curse of Monkey Island</em>, the LucasArts adventure just before this one, a game which seemed at the time to herald a renaissance in the studio&#8217;s puzzle designs. There, you&#8217;re always provided with an explicit set of goals, usually in the form of a literal shopping list. Thus even when the mechanics of the puzzles themselves push the boundaries of real-world logic, you at least have a pretty good sense of where you should be focusing your efforts. Here, you&#8217;re mostly left to guess what Tim Schafer would like to have happen to Manny next. You stumble around trying to shake something loose, trying to figure out what you can do and then doing it just because you can. By no means is it lost on me that this sense of confusion arises to a large extent because <em>Grim Fandango</em> is such a character-driven story, one which eschews the mechanistic tic-tac-toe of other adventure-game plots. But recognizing this irony doesn&#8217;t make it any less frustrating when you&#8217;re wandering around with no clue what the story wants from you.</p>
<p>Compounding the frustrations of the puzzles are the frustrations of the interface. You don&#8217;t use the mouse at all; everything is done with the numeric keypad, or, if you&#8217;re lucky enough to have one, a console-style controller. (At the time <em>Grim Fandango</em> was released, virtually no one playing games on computers did.) <em>Grim Fandango&#8217;</em>s mode of navigation is most reminiscent of the <a href="/2023/11/putting-the-j-in-the-rpg-part-1-dorakue">console-based JRPGs</a> of its era, such as the hugely popular <a href="/2023/12/putting-the-j-in-the-rpg-part-3-playing-final-fantasy-vii-or-old-man-yells-at-jrpg"><em>Final Fantasy VII</em></a>, which sold over 10 million copies on the PlayStation during the late 1990s. Yet in practice it&#8217;s far more irritating, because you have to interact with the environment here on a much more granular level. LucasArts themselves referred to their method of steering Manny about as a &#8220;tank&#8221; interface, a descriptor which turns out to be all too descriptive. It really does feel like you&#8217;re driving a bulky, none too agile vehicle through an obstacle course of scenery.</p>
<div id="attachment_6151" style="width: 610px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://www.filfre.net/2024/11/grim-fandango/angle/" rel="attachment wp-att-6151"><img decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-6151" class="wp-image-6151" src="https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/angle-300x225.png" alt="" width="600" height="450" srcset="https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/angle-300x225.png 300w, https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/angle.png 640w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-6151" class="wp-caption-text">Make no mistake: the 3D engine makes possible some truly striking views. But too often the designers prioritize visual aesthetics over playability.</p></div>
<p>In the final reckoning, then, an approach that is fine in a JRPG makes just about every aspect of an old-school, puzzle-solving adventure game &#8212; which is what <em>Grim Fandango</em> remains in form and spirit when you strip all of the details of its implementation away &#8212; more awkward and less fun. Instead of having hotspots in the environment that light up when you pass a mouse cursor over them, as you do in a SCUMM adventure, you have to watch Manny&#8217;s head carefully as you drive him around; when it turns to look in a certain direction, that means there&#8217;s something he can interact with there. Needless to say, it&#8217;s all too easy to miss a turn of his head, and thereby to miss something vital to your progress through the game.</p>
<div id="attachment_6152" style="width: 610px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://www.filfre.net/2024/11/grim-fandango/inventory/" rel="attachment wp-att-6152"><img decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-6152" class="wp-image-6152" src="https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/inventory-300x225.png" alt="" width="600" height="450" srcset="https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/inventory-300x225.png 300w, https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/inventory.png 640w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-6152" class="wp-caption-text">The inventory system is also fairly excruciating. Instead of being able to bring up a screen showing all of the items Manny is carrying, you have to cycle through them one by one by punching a key or controller button over and over, listening to him drone out their descriptions over and over as you do so. This approach precludes using one inventory object on another one, cutting off a whole avenue of puzzle design.</p></div>
<p>Now, the apologists among you &#8212; and this game does have an inordinate number of them &#8212; might respond to these complaints of mine by making reference to the old cliché that, for every door that is closed in life (and presumably in games as well), another one is opened. And in theory, the new engine really does open a door to new types of puzzles that are more tactile and embodied, that make you feel more a part of the game&#8217;s world. To Tim Schafer&#8217;s credit, he does try to include these sorts of puzzles in quite a few places. To our detriment, though, they turn out to be the worst puzzles in the game, relying on finicky positioning and timing and giving no useful feedback when you get those things slightly wrong.</p>
<p>But even when <em>Grim Fandango</em> presents puzzles that could easily have been implemented in SCUMM, they&#8217;re made way more annoying than they ought to be by the engine and interface. When you&#8217;re reduced to that final adventurer&#8217;s gambit of just trying everything on everything, as you most assuredly will be from time to time here, the exercise takes many times longer than it would using SCUMM, what with having to laboriously drive Manny about from place to place.</p>
<p>Taken as a game rather than the movie it often seems more interested in being, <em>Grim Fandango</em> boils down to a lumpy stew of overthought and thoughtlessness. In the former category, there&#8217;s an unpleasant ideological quality to its approach, with its prioritization of some hazy ethic of 3D-powered &#8220;immersion&#8221; and its insistence that no visible interface elements whatsoever can appear onscreen, even when these choices actively damage the player&#8217;s experience. This is where Sid Meier can <a href="/2017/03/whats-the-matter-with-covert-action">helpfully step in to remind us</a> that it is the player who is meant to be having the fun in a game, not the designer.</p>
<p>The thoughtlessness comes in the lack of consideration of what <em>kind</em> of game <em>Grim Fandango</em> is meant to be. Like all big-tent gaming genres, the adventure genre subsumes a lot of different styles of game with different priorities. Some adventures are primarily about exploration and puzzle solving. And that&#8217;s fine, although one does hope that those games execute their puzzles better than this one does. But <em>Grim Fandango</em> is not primarily about its puzzles; it wants to take you on a ride, to sweep you along on the wings of a compelling story. And boy, does it have a compelling story to share with you. For this reason, it would be best served by streamlined puzzles that don&#8217;t get too much in the way of your progress. The ones we have, however, are not only frustrating in themselves but murder on the story&#8217;s pacing, undermining what ought to be <em>Grim Fandango&#8217;</em>s greatest strengths. A game like this one that is best enjoyed with a walkthrough open on the desk beside it is, in this critic&#8217;s view at least, a broken game by definition.</p>
<p>As with so many near-miss games, the really frustrating thing about <em>Grim Fandango</em> is that the worst of its problems could so easily have been fixed with just a bit more testing, a bit more time, and a few more people who were empowered to push back against Tim Schafer&#8217;s more dogmatic tendencies. For the 2015 remastered version of the game, Schafer did grudgingly agree to include an alternative point-and-click interface that is more like that of a SCUMM adventure. The results verge on the transformational. By no means does the addition of a mouse cursor remedy all of the infelicities of the puzzle design, but it does make battering your way through them considerably less painful. If my less-than-systematic investigations on YouTube are anything to go by, this so-old-it&#8217;s-new-again interface has become by far the most common way to play the game today.</p>

Note the mouse cursor. The new interface is reportedly implemented entirely in in-engine Lua scripts rather than requiring any re-programming of the GrimE engine itself. This means that it would have been perfectly possible to include as an option in the original release.</p></div>
<p>In other places, the fixes could have been even simpler than revamping the interface. A shocking number of puzzles could have been converted from infuriating to delightful by nothing more than an extra line or two of dialog from Manny or one of the other characters. As it is, too many of the verbal nudges that do exist are too obscure by half and are given only once in passing, as part of conversations that can never be repeated. Hints for Part Four are to be found only in Part One; I defy even an elephant to remember them when the time comes to apply them. All told,<em> Grim Fandango</em> has the distinct odor of a game that no one other than those who were too close to it to see it clearly ever really tried to play before it was put in a box and shoved out the door. There was a time when seeking the feedback of outsiders was a standard part of LucasArts&#8217;s adventure-development loop. Alas, that era was long past by the time of <em>Grim Fandango</em>.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, <em>Grim Fandango</em> was accorded a fairly rapturous reception in the gaming press when it was released in the last week of October in 1998, just in time for Halloween and the Mexican Day of the Dead which follows it on November 1. Its story, characters, and setting were justifiably praised, while the deficiencies of its interface and puzzle design were more often than not relegated to a paragraph or two near the end of the review. This is surprising, but not inexplicable. There was a certain sadness in the trade press &#8212; almost a collective guilt &#8212; about the diminished prospects of the adventure game in these latter years of the decade. Meanwhile LucasArts was still the beneficiary of a tremendous amount of goodwill, thanks to the many classics they had served up during those earlier, better years for the genre as a whole. <em>Grim Fandango</em> was held up as a sort of standard bearer for the embattled graphic adventure, the ideal mix of tradition and innovation to serve as proof that the genre was still relevant in a <a href="/2023/04/the-next-generation-in-graphics-part-1-three-dimensions-in-software-or-quake-and-its-discontents">post-<em>Quake</em></a>, <a href="/2024/07/starcraft-a-history-in-two-acts">post-<em>Starcraft</em></a> world.</p>
<p>For many years, the standard narrative had it that the unwashed masses of gamers utterly failed to respond to the magazines&#8217; evangelism, that <em>Grim Fandango</em> became an abject failure in the marketplace. In more recent years, Tim Schafer has muddied those waters somewhat by claiming that the game actually sold close to half a million copies. I rather suspect that the truth is somewhere between these two extremes. Sales of a quarter of a million certainly don&#8217;t strike me as unreasonable once foreign markets are factored into the equation. Such a figure would have been enough to keep <em>Grim Fandango</em> from losing much if any money, but would have provided LucasArts with little motivation to make any more such boldly original adventure games. And indeed, LucasArts would release only one more adventure game of any stripe in their history. It would use the GrimE engine, but it would otherwise play it about as safe as it possibly could, by being yet another sequel to the venerable but beloved <em>Secret of Monkey Island</em>.</p>
<p>As I was at pains to note earlier, I do see what causes some people to rate <em>Grim Fandango</em> so highly, and I definitely don&#8217;t think any less of them for doing so. For my part, though, I&#8217;m something of a stickler on some points. To my mind, interactivity is the very quality that separates games from other forms of media, making it hard for me to pronounce a game &#8220;good&#8221; that botches it. I&#8217;ve learned to be deeply suspicious of games whose most committed fans want to talk about everything other than that which you the player actually <em>do</em> in them. The same applies when a game&#8217;s creators display the same tendency. Listening to the developers&#8217; commentary tracks in the remastered edition of <em>Grim Fandango </em>(who would have imagined in 1998 that games would someday come with commentary tracks?), I was shocked by how little talk there was about the gameplay. It was all lighting and dialog beats and soundtrack stabs and Z-buffers instead &#8212; all of which is really, really important in its place, but none of which can yield a great game on its own. Tellingly, when the subject of puzzle design did come up, it always seemed to be in an off-hand, borderline dismissive way. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know how players are supposed to figure out this puzzle,&#8221; says Tim Schafer outright at one point. Such a statement from your lead designer is never a good sign.</p>
<p>But I won&#8217;t belabor the issue any further. Suffice to say that <em>Grim Fandango</em> is doomed to remain a promising might-have-been rather than a classic in my book. As a story and a world, it&#8217;s kind of amazing. It&#8217;s just a shame that the gameplay part of this game isn&#8217;t equally inspired.</p>

<p>The fifth season of <em>The X-Files</em>, spanning from 1997 to 1998, marked the absolute zenith of the show&#8217;s popularity, when it put up the best average ratings in its history. Everybody seemed to want a piece of its action; even <a href="/2016/11/the-prophet-of-cyberspace">William Gibson</a> and Stephen King submitted scripts that season.</p>
<p>As we learned in an earlier article, <em>The X-Files </em>was always two shows in one. One show consisted of the &#8220;mythology&#8221; episodes: a heavily serialized, ever more convoluted tale of extraterrestrial interference in the affairs of humans and a myriad of conspiracies deriving therefrom, in which the stakes were, it had by now been revealed, positively apocalyptic in scope, involving alien plans to exterminate the human race and repopulate the planet with their own kind. The other show consisted of one-off &#8220;monster of the week&#8221; episodes, which were freer to go to unexpected places in terms of form and content and to not always take themselves so darn seriously. The hardcore <em>X-Files</em> fandom that had sustained the show through its first couple of seasons had been built on the back of the first type of episode, and this was still the type that got the most attention even in the glossy mainstream press. Yet there&#8217;s a strong critical consensus today &#8212; a consensus with which I heartily agree &#8212; that almost all of the most enduring episodes are actually of the &#8220;monster of the week&#8221; sort.</p>
<p>It was and is almost impossible to reconcile the coexistence of the two types of episode in the same fictional universe. Doing so demands that we accept that Mulder and Scully periodically decide to take a holiday from saving humanity from extinction in order to check up on rumors of Yet Another Freaky Serial Killer in Podunk, Idaho. The creators themselves were by no means unaware of the cognitive dissonance. One argument they deployed in response was a plea to treat Mulder and Scully like Superman, Nancy Drew, or Kirk and Spock had once been treated: as characters who simply have adventures in the abstract, without sweating the details of chronology. &#8220;Who knows in what order the fictional lives of Mulder and Scully take place?&#8221; said producer-director Rob Bowman. &#8220;We never said that that was week two and this is week three in their lives. We are just saying that this is episode two and this is episode three and it happened <em>whenever</em>.&#8221; Such hand-waving may have been thoroughly out of step with obsessive <em>X-Files</em> fandom, but it does indeed seem like the most satisfying way to approach the series today, not least because it allows us to appreciate the best of the standalone episodes as the little self-contained marvels they are.</p>
<p>I speak of episodes like Chris Carter&#8217;s own <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0751232/">&#8220;The Post-Modern Prometheus,&#8221;</a> whose name is a play on the subtitle of Mary Shelley&#8217;s classic novel <em>Frankenstein; or, the Modern Prometheus</em>. It&#8217;s a funny and sad retelling of that story, moved to twentieth-century small-town America and shot in stark black and white, the better to evoke the old monster movies from which the show drew so much inspiration. But it&#8217;s more than just an homage; the &#8220;postmodern&#8221; in the title is amply justified. The story is barreling along toward its inevitable tragic climax when Mulder decides that tragedy just won&#8217;t do. He demands to see the writer, who turns out to be a chubby teenager who&#8217;s drawing a comic book. And suddenly the entire gang &#8212; Mulder, Scully, the monster, and your stereotypical gaggle of pitchfork-wielding villagers, who were getting ready to string the last-named up from the nearest tree a minute earlier &#8212; are taking a road trip to see Cher, the monster&#8217;s favorite singer. She sings <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bye6PUz9Rfk">&#8220;Walking in Memphis,&#8221;</a> his favorite song, and Mulder and Scully dance together with big smiles and glowing eyes while the monster shakes his booty right up there onstage. It&#8217;s weird and sweet and funny and yet still achingly sad at its core, and just thinking about it leaves me with a tear in my eye. I&#8217;ve just about decided that it&#8217;s my favorite episode of <em>The X-Files</em> ever. And it turns out that I&#8217;m in pretty good company there: both Chris Carter and David Duchovny have said the same.</p>

</div>
<p>Vince Gilligan&#8217;s <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0751081/">&#8220;Bad Blood&#8221;</a> is another standout from the fifth season. It has Mulder and Scully investigating an apparent vampire on the loose in a small Texas town &#8212; not exactly revolutionary subject matter for the show. Yet Gilligan turns the episode into a riff on <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0042876/"><em>Rashomon</em></a>, letting us see the story from the points of view of both Mulder and Scully. For example, the sheriff of the town seen through Scully&#8217;s admiring eyes is the epitome of a handsome Southern gentleman, through Mulder&#8217;s jealous ones a bucktoothed hick. Once again, I find myself in good company in highlighting this episode. Gillian Anderson has named it as her own all-time favorite: &#8220;It was fun and challenging to film and even more fun to watch.&#8221;</p>

<p>The fifth-season finale led right into <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120902/">the big <em>X-Files</em> feature film</a>, which had actually been shot almost a year before, during the break between the fourth and fifth seasons. It was a mythology episode blown up in length by a factor of about two and a half, and was neither notably better nor worse than that description would imply. The movie was perhaps most notable for existing at all; it was highly unusual to make a theatrical film set in the world of a television series that was still on the air. Chris Carter and Fox had been inspired by the success of <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0111280/"><em>Star Trek Generations</em></a>, featuring the cast from <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0092455/"><em>Star Trek: The Next Generation</em></a>, but that film and its sequels had come out only after the television series in question had wrapped for good. There was some thought that <em>The X-Files</em> too might transition into a purely cinematic franchise at some point, although it wasn&#8217;t clear when or how that might happen. &#8220;Hopefully,&#8221; said Gillian Anderson in an interview at the time, &#8220;the film will be so successful that the series will trail off and we&#8217;ll just be doing movies once in a while.&#8221;</p>
<p>Despite the limitations which its tight connection to the serialized mythology of the television show would seem to place on its mass appeal, the <em>X-Files</em> movie grossed $84 million in the United States alone, enough to make it the twentieth biggest film of the year there. All told, it was a solid performance, if not quite the gangbusters one that might have prompted Fox to think of turning <em>The X-Files</em> into a spectacle available exclusively on big rather than small screens sooner rather than later.</p>
<p>Even with all of its success, however, the show was navigating some logistical turbulence. David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson had both signed five-season contracts at the outset, and Duchovny wasn&#8217;t at all sure he wanted to renew his as the fifth season was winding down. He had aspirations of making the leap from television star to becoming a sought-after leading man in movies that weren&#8217;t named <em>The X-Files</em>, but this would be hard to do if he had to be off in Vancouver playing Mulder for all but a few months of every year. Further, he had just gotten married to the actress Téa Leoni, whose role on the sitcom <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0112090/"><em>The Naked Truth</em></a> bound her to Hollywood. Duchovny gave Fox an ultimatum: he would join Gillian Anderson in signing a two-year contract extension if and only if the entire production was moved to Southern California.</p>
<p>It was a tough call &#8212; the move would make the show dramatically more expensive to produce each week &#8212; but nobody could imagine <em>The X-Files</em> without Mulder, and certainly nobody thought the show had run its course as of yet, not when it had just enjoyed its biggest season ever. So, Duchovny got his way. The folks who were working on the show in Vancouver were given a choice between relocation and severance packages. These dozens of people who had their lives so disrupted so that one man could have the arrangement that pleased him might be forgiven for concluding that David Duchovny was a self-entitled jerk. He didn&#8217;t do his reputation among them any more favors in the aftermath of the move, when he went around disparaging their hometown of Vancouver and its &#8220;400 inches of rain per day&#8221; in interviews on the talk-show circuit. But so be it; the show must go on.</p>
<p>The results of the move to California were evident from the first shot of the first episode of the sixth season: a desert landscape baking under a clear blue sky. That wasn&#8217;t the sort of shot you were ever going to get in Vancouver. The default tone of the show brightened in tandem with the sunshine quotient, prompting derision from some quarters of its hardcore fandom, who labeled this new Southern Californian incarnation &#8220;<em>X-Files</em> Lite.&#8221;</p>
<p>But these people do not speak for me. For all that I wouldn&#8217;t leap to defend David Duchovny from anyone who said he was a bit of a tool at this stage of his life, I&#8217;m afraid I can&#8217;t get behind those other criticisms. In fact, I&#8217;ll go way out on a limb and say that I like the sixth season the best of all of them, and that at least some of the seventh season isn&#8217;t that far behind it in my esteem. To my mind, the standalone episodes got warmer and wiser and smarter and funnier than they had ever been before. Granted, most continue to play with established mass-media archetypes. If not usually original in conception, though, they&#8217;re sly and clever in execution, with that good old Mulder and Scully charm and with more willingness than ever to stretch and bend the formal boundaries of the show. In their willingness to burrow deep into the universals of life and fate, I daresay that some of them remind me of nothing so much as the masterful short stories of Ted Chiang.</p>

Simpson Bronco chase</a> over the highways of Los Angeles. Indeed, it initially presents itself as a special news broadcast that&#8217;s airing in place of your normally scheduled <em>X-Files</em> episode; these seasons do a lot of this sort of mucking about with credits sequences, etc., as if the fiction is escaping from the cage in which it is meant to be contained. The episode evolves into <em>The X-Files&#8217;</em>s take on the tautly wound 1994 film <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0111257/"><em>Speed</em></a>. Here as there, the plot hinges on a vehicle that cannot stop if dire consequences are to be avoided. In this case, though, it&#8217;s Fox Mulder who&#8217;s behind the wheel, with a man behind him in the backseat who will die if he doesn&#8217;t keep moving. The reason why he will die may be down to the usual conspiratorial mumbo-jumbo, but that has little bearing on the propulsive problem at hand. This was arguably the first time <em>The X-Files</em> went full-on action movie &#8212; and, lo and behold, it does it rather brilliantly. (In a meta sense, &#8220;Drive&#8221; is also famous as the episode where Vince Gilligan first met Bryan Cranston, the man you see in the backseat above. Cranston would go on to become the star of <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0903747/"><em>Breaking Bad</em></a>, Gilligan&#8217;s own acclaimed television show.)</p></div>

It was worth the wait. Defying a promise Carter made in the early days of the show to never fall down the wormhole of time-travel fiction, the script does indeed send Mulder back in time, to the first days of the Second World War, where he winds up aboard a passenger ship that&#8217;s about to be commandeered by some of its Nazi passengers. Doppelgängers of both Cancer Man and Scully are aboard, for reasons that aren&#8217;t entirely clear. The important thing is that this gives William B. Davis the chance to try on an SS uniform that suits him to a tee, and gives Gillian Anderson the opportunity to try her hand at playing a hard-edged <em>femme fatale</em> straight out of a Raymond Chandler novel. The episode is fast-paced and frothy and a little bit campy. Perhaps most of all, though, it&#8217;s a <em>tour de force</em> of technical film-making: in conscious emulation of Alfred Hitchcock&#8217;s experimental classic <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0040746"><em>Rope</em></a>, its 45 minutes consist of just 24 ultra-extended single-camera takes. (By way of comparison, the average <em>X-Files</em> episode contained around 1000 switches of perspective.) &#8220;To watch &#8216;Triangle&#8217; now,&#8221; writes the critic Emily St. James, &#8220;is to remember a time when this was the most daring show on television.&#8221;</p></div>

In what can all too easily be read as a meta-fictional message to a certain kind of rabid <em>X-Files</em> fan, Scully idly wonders whether the two of them will ever outgrow this stuff and make better, fuller lives for themselves. Shortly thereafter, they get waylaid by the authorities, the infamous Men In Black who are always lurking around places like this. But then a test of an alien spacecraft creates a quantum disturbance that swaps Mulder&#8217;s consciousness into the lead MiB&#8217;s body, and vice versa. Much discomfort and hilarity ensues, as Mulder learns that being an MiB is just a government job like any other. While he tries to adapt to life as a paunchy, middle-aged family man, his alter ego embraces with gusto the swinging-bachelor lifestyle that Mulder&#8217;s looks have always cut him out for. Lessons are learned on both sides, until a way is found to reverse the trend. In other words, this episode turns all of the stuff about aliens and conspiracies into an excuse to tell a more resonant, universal story about life choices, opportunity costs, and roads not taken. Plus it&#8217;s really, really funny.</p></div>

The episode is another meditation on life choices, this one with a spooky Dickensian vibe, with some crackerjack comic-tragic dialog. But my favorite part is the ending, when Mulder and Scully hunker down in the Mulder&#8217;s cozy apartment to exchange the gifts they promised one another they wouldn&#8217;t buy.

In <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0751239">&#8220;The Unnatural,&#8221;</a> which he directed as well as wrote, he cleverly juxtaposes <em>The X-Files&#8217;</em>s standard version of aliens with aliens of another type: the Black baseball players who braved scorn and violence to desegregate the sport in the 1940s. It&#8217;s a lovely, luminous episode that oozes the magical-realist quality the show was embracing so successfully by this point. Sure, it owes a lot to <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0097351"><em>Field of Dreams</em></a> in tone and feel, but it&#8217;s hard to disparage it for that. Given the choice between conspiracy theories and the crack of wood on cowhide on a starry summer night, I&#8217;ll take the latter every time.</p></div>

One of the urtexts of Fox&#8217;s brand of tabloid journalism was the series called <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0096563"><em>Cops</em></a>, an early example of &#8220;reality&#8221; television in which a camera crew rode along in the backseat of a police cruiser on the mean streets of a big American city. (Rather astonishingly, <em>Cops</em> is still on television to this day, being in its 36th season as of this writing.) Vince Gilligan&#8217;s <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0751264">&#8220;X-Cops&#8221;</a> is a picture-perfect re-creation of the show, from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3i7ndJL9YQ">the <em>Cops </em>theme song and credits sequence</a> that take the place of the standard <em>X-Files</em> version of same to the shaky handheld camerawork, from the suspects and witnesses who live in a liminal space between sympathy and ridicule to the know-it-all police officers who give us the benefit of their hard-won wisdom in running commentaries. Into this hard-bitten milieu are dropped Mulder and Scully on the trail of a monster of the week. It&#8217;s incongruous and bizarre and most of all hilarious, another of those episodes that are so brave and cheeky and completely out of the box that it&#8217;s hard to believe they were actually made. Who would ever have imagined during the first season of <em>The X-Files</em> that the premise would someday be bent far enough to yield episodes like this one?</p></div>
<div id="attachment_6140" style="width: 610px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://www.filfre.net/2024/10/the-truth-is-out-there-part-4-the-downside-of-belief/s7e21/" rel="attachment wp-att-6140"><img decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-6140" class="wp-image-6140" src="https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/s7e21-300x169.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="338" srcset="https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/s7e21-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/s7e21-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/s7e21.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-6140" class="wp-caption-text">Lately I&#8217;ve been indulging in a thought experiment, or maybe more of a wish-fulfillment fantasy. Wouldn&#8217;t it have been neat if <em>The X-Files</em> had taken a bow already after a sixth season that was absolutely spectacular? Said season would have been created by junking all of the increasingly tiring and tiresome mythology episodes from the extant sixth and seventh seasons and then throwing out the handful of clunkers among the standalone episodes as well. Do all that, and you&#8217;d end up with what I&#8217;m going to have the audacity to call one of the best single seasons of television ever created. Such a victory tour would necessarily conclude with Vince Gillian&#8217;s <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0751145">&#8220;Je Souhaite,&#8221;</a> the last standalone episode of the real seventh season, an episode that&#8217;s as universal as a fairy tale &#8212; which is almost literally what it is, come to think of it. Here Mulder and Scully meet a genie &#8212; yes, complete with the bottle &#8212; who has the power to grant three wishes. We all know how stories like this tend to go. Be very, very careful what you wish for, kids! When Mulder gets his chance to wish, he asks for peace on Earth &#8212; not a good choice, because the easiest way to achieve that is to simply remove the species that has been causing all of the chaos on our planet all these centuries. But then, after using his second wish to undo his first and repopulate the planet, he hits upon the perfect third wish, by looking at the genie herself with eyes of empathy. The best way to change the world, he realizes, is by showing kindness to the people who are right there in front of you. What a perfect grace note that would have been for the show to go out on&#8230;</p></div>

<p><code> </code><br />
Whether you love or hate the sun-kissed <em>X-Files</em> of the sixth season and beyond, there can be no question that it marked a commercial turning point for the show &#8212; and not in a good way. By the end of the sixth season, the average episode&#8217;s viewership had dropped by almost 25 percent from what it had been just one year earlier. Measured by the standard metrics, <em>The X-Files</em> was still a popular show, but it no longer took pride of place at the center of the zeitgeist, no longer garnered shiny awards and glossy magazine covers and navel-gazing think-pieces from critics and pundits. It had reached the top of its mountain of destiny a year earlier, and now it was on the downward slope that lay just beyond.</p>
<p>What were the reasons for its decline? I&#8217;m tempted to say it had something to do with the mythology episodes that had always dominated in public discussion of the show. These had by now grown so convoluted and ridiculous that it was becoming hard for even the most sanguine optimist to believe they were going anywhere coherent. (Scully is abducted by aliens! Scully is back! Scully has incurable alien-caused brain cancer! Scully is cured! The aliens aren&#8217;t real, they were just a carefully engineered distraction all along! No, belay that, actually the aliens <em>are</em> real! Mulder is abducted! Mulder is back!) &#8220;The mythology was becoming an awful lot for people to continue to keep track of,&#8221; admits <em>X-Files</em> executive producer and writer Frank Spotnitz.</p>
<p>At the same time, though, this objection hardly began with the sixth season. The more encompassing explanation for the show&#8217;s decline in popularity is likely the simple fact that even the biggest cultural phenomena always run their course and then give way to fresh things. To wit: right in the middle of <em>The X-Files&#8217;</em>s sixth season, the cable-television channel HBO aired the first episode of <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0141842/"><em>The Sopranos</em></a>, a heavily serialized mobster drama that was free of most of the strictures of broadcast television, among them restrictions on language, violence, and sexual content, a rigid 45-minute running time for every single episode, and the need to churn out twenty episodes or more every single season. <em>The Sopranos </em>inaugurated the fifteen-year stretch that some critics today like to call The Golden Age of Cable Television, during which the medium eclipsed theatrical films in many respects to become the most prestigious and satisfying of all forms of moving image. In illustrating that long-term serialized storytelling could attract a mass audience on television in genres other than the soap opera, <em>The X-Files</em> was an important forerunner to shows like <em>The Sopranos</em>, <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0306414/"><em>The Wire</em></a>, <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0804503/"><em>Mad Men</em></a>, and <em>Breaking Bad</em>. But it was not one of their peers.</p>
<p>The gradual decline of <em>The X-Files&#8217;</em>s popularity continued in the seventh season. Chris Carter and his colleagues actually went into the season thinking it would probably be the last. Not only were the ratings getting slowly but inexorably worse, but the contracts of David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson were due to run out once again when the season was over, and Duchovny was less interested than ever in renewing his. In fact, he was suing Fox and Chris Carter personally for allegedly selling syndication rights to the show to a subsidiary network for less than their full market value, which impacted his own residual earnings. As one would expect, the legal battle &#8220;didn&#8217;t help the creative energy,&#8221; as Carter put it.</p>
<p>This late in its run, the show had just one surefire way of making headlines again, however briefly. In light of this, the makers&#8217; handling of the transition of Mulder and Scully from platonic partners to a romantic couple is as bizarre as any monster of the week that ever appeared on the show. In Vince Gilligan and Frank Spotnitz&#8217;s <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0751160/">&#8220;Millennium&#8221;</a> &#8212; an episode whose main function was providing closure for the semi-spinoff series of the same name, which had been abruptly cancelled after three seasons &#8212; Mulder and Scully celebrate the arrival of Y2K by sharing their first ever onscreen kiss. Thirteen episodes later, in <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0751071/">&#8220;All Things,&#8221;</a> which was written and directed by Gillian Anderson, it&#8217;s off-handedly revealed that the two are now sleeping in the same bed. And that&#8217;s it. Restraint has its virtues, but come on! Shippers who had been waiting 150 episodes for the other shoe &#8212; or perhaps some other articles of clothing &#8212; to drop were rewarded with this damp squib. I have no idea why the makers didn&#8217;t turn &#8220;Mulder and Scully finally do the deed!&#8221; into a mass-media event. As it was, they squandered their last bit of dry powder from their glory days in about as anticlimactic a fashion as can be imagined.</p>
<p>The show easily could have &#8212; and probably should have &#8212; ended after the seventh season. Yet it didn&#8217;t. David Duchovny agreed to settle his lawsuit with Fox, and then shocked everyone by agreeing as well to play Mulder just a little bit longer &#8212; for another half of a season, to be precise. The powers that were at Fox decided that was good enough for them, especially given that they didn&#8217;t have any strong candidates to hand to air in place of <em>The X-Files</em> on Sunday nights. And so it was on to the eighth season. It was decided that Mulder would be absent for the first half of the season, having been abducted by aliens. (What other explanation could there possibly be?) Then he would return for the second half, so that the show could finish strong.</p>
<p>An actor named Robert Patrick won the unenviable role of Special Agent John Doggett, the replacement for one of the most iconic television characters of recent history. This may explain why everyone was at such pains not to call him a replacement. &#8220;Robert Patrick is an <em>addition</em> to the show,&#8221; insisted Chris Carter. When David Duchovny did come back halfway through the season, he immediately began to complain loudly about having become &#8220;peripheral. Mulder&#8217;s story was one of three stories going on and it didn&#8217;t feel like the same show to me.&#8221; At the risk of editorializing too much, I must say that my mind is fairly boggled by the egotism on display in this comment. What did he expect would happen?</p>
<p>By the last episode of the eighth season, when Mulder and Scully had a baby together, the proverbial shark had been pretty well jumped. And yet the second half of the season, after Duchovny&#8217;s return, actually managed to slightly outdraw the end of the previous one with the viewing public. The show got renewed yet again, even though Duchovny now declared himself to be gone for good &#8212; no ifs, ands, or buts about it.</p>
<p>The first episode of the ninth season had yet to air when, on September 11, 2001, terrorists hijacked four American passenger planes, flying two of them into the World Trade Center in New York City and one into the Pentagon in Washington, D.C. (The hijackers of the fourth airplane, which was intended for the White House, met with heroic resistance from the passengers, and that plane wound up crashing over Pennsylvania, killing everyone onboard.) <em>The X-Files</em> was something of a shambling anachronism already by that point in the eyes of most television viewers, but this tragic day of infamy cemented that status. The mood of the nation changed on a dime; just like that, the epoch that some now call &#8220;The Long Nineties&#8221; came to a smashing end.</p>
<p>The 1990s had been the Age of Irony, when <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTWKbfoikeg">an anthemic hit single</a> could be named after a brand of teenybopper deodorant, when videogames like <a href="/2023/04/the-next-generation-in-graphics-part-1-three-dimensions-in-software-or-quake-and-its-discontents"><em>Duke Nukem 3D</em></a> were reveling gleefully in senseless violence amidst the trashy detritus of conspicuous consumption. And why should it have been otherwise, during a decade whose biggest ongoing news story was the dot.com bubble? &#8220;We&#8217;re the middle children of history, man,&#8221; said Brad Pitt of Generation Slacker in <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0137523/"><em>Fight Club</em></a>. &#8220;We have no Great War, no Great Depression.&#8221;</p>
<p>Earnestness made a big comeback after September 11. Suddenly people had a cause again, Wanted to Believe again &#8212; not in the existence of aliens, conspiracy theories about which now seemed like the childish diversions that they had always been, but in the very government and military the conspiracy theorists had spent so many years questioning if not reviling. By September 21, the approval rating of President George W. Bush, who had lost a national popular vote to Al Gore just ten months earlier but squeaked out a controversial win in the Electoral College, had soared to 90 percent, the highest ever recorded.</p>
<p>It was difficult to imagine how any show could be more out of step with the changed times than <em>The X-Files</em> was. &#8220;<em>The X-Files</em> is the product of a time that is passed,&#8221; wrote the columnist Andrew Stuttaford. &#8220;It is a relic of the Clinton years, as dated as a dot.com share certificate, a stained blue dress, or Kato Kaelin&#8217;s reminiscences.&#8221; All of which is to say that it was all but foreordained that its ninth season would be its last before said season ever aired its first episode. The new standard bearer of the American zeitgeist was <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0285331/"><em>24</em></a>, another serialized show about a law-enforcement agent, but this time one who had no doubts whatsoever about the righteousness of his country or his government, a two-fisted true believer who wasn&#8217;t above a spot of torture when it was the only way to foil the Axis of Evil. Pop music and videogames too heeded the call: Celine Dion&#8217;s nerve-jangling rendition of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=syOEI9y7miM">&#8220;God Bless America&#8221;</a> climbed the charts as the lead single of a charity album of the same name, while <em>Duke Nukem</em> yielded to <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/game/10826/call-of-duty/"><em>Call of Duty</em></a>.</p>
<p>Amidst it all, <em>The X-Files</em> shambled through its last season as best it could. (Raising a defiant middle finger to the scoffers, the makers even named one episode <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0751148/">&#8220;Jump the Shark.&#8221;</a>) David Duchovny, whose career as a cinematic leading man wasn&#8217;t going quite so well as he had thought it would, agreed to rejoin the cast for <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0408347/">a 90-minute series finale</a>, which endeavored to wrap up the mythology story lines about as neatly as could be done in that span of time. &#8220;It gives viewers answer after answer, until it feels like we&#8217;re reading somebody&#8217;s Geocities fan page for wild theories about the show,&#8221; writes Emily St. James of the finale. &#8220;But it&#8217;s also dramatically, death-defyingly boring.&#8221; When all was said and done, Cancer Man got blown up by a helicopter and everyone else rode off into the sunset of a changed America.</p>
<p>But they didn&#8217;t go away forever. Anyone at all familiar with the post-millennial media landscape knows that <em>nothing</em> ever seems to go away forever. There have been two attempts to date to revive <em>The X-Files</em> since that last hurrah of 2002.</p>
<p>In 2008, Chris Carter got the old gang back together for a movie. <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0443701/"><em>The X-Files: I Want to Believe</em></a> had a budget less than half the size of the first <em>X-Files</em> film before adjusting for inflation. &#8220;It&#8217;s funny, but on the series we prided ourselves each week with making a little movie,&#8221; muses Carter. &#8220;Then, when it came time to do the second <em>X-Files</em> movie, we were given the money and the opportunity to make, literally, a little movie.&#8221; Probably smartly, he chose to do an expanded monster-of-the-week episode rather than reopening the Pandora&#8217;s box of the mythology. Even so, it was hard to figure out what reason the film really had to exist; it came a little too soon to be a full-blown nostalgia play, even as its moody atmosphere still felt badly out of joint with the times around it during that summer of 2008, when Barack Obama&#8217;s &#8220;Yes, We Can!&#8221; was the slogan of the moment. The critics were not impressed, and its box-office receipts were less than a third of the first film&#8217;s &#8212; again, without adjusting for inflation.</p>
<p>Seven and a half years later, Carter made a more concerted effort to revive the show, this time as another television series on Fox &#8212; albeit one with dramatically truncated episode counts in comparison to those of its original run. By now, the times were falling more into step with <em>The X-Files&#8217;</em>s tendency to see everything in the world through the lens of conspiracy. (More on that subject momentarily.) Nevertheless, the new episodes never quite landed like a lot of observers expected them to. The scripts felt underwhelming, the alien stuff way past its sell-by date, and one at least of the two leads seemed a little bored and distracted. Ironically, it was Gillian Anderson now who wasn&#8217;t at all sure she wanted to be there, and who most obviously turned in performances that reflected this ambivalence. The fact was that she was a more sought-after actor than David Duchovny this far along in their respective careers, with a larger number of interesting roles in both her past and her future.</p>

<p>The revival sputtered out in 2018, after two seasons with a total of sixteen episodes between them. As of this writing, <em>The X-Files&#8217;</em>s legacy is once more being left in peace. But never say never, especially in these current times of ours when nostalgia is a bigger business than it has ever been.</p>
<hr />
<p><code> </code><br />
And what can we say about the legacy of <em>The X-Files</em> now, a quarter-century after its high time in the zeitgeist?</p>
<p>Well, as I think that even many of its most zealous boosters will admit by now, it was a show subject to wild swings in quality, not just from season to season but from week to week. When all is said and done, <em>The X-Files </em>probably produced only about 20 to 25 episodes &#8212; that is to say, about one season&#8217;s worth of them, in the course of nine seasons &#8212; that might legitimately be called classics. Still, that&#8217;s a lot more than nothing, and a better batting average than the vast majority of television shows achieve. And betwixt and between its standout moments of brilliance, <em>The X-Files</em> offered plenty more episodes that remain perfectly watchable today despite their flaws, especially if you&#8217;re one of those who can enjoy just hanging out with its two charming leads.</p>
<p>On the broader canvas of television history, <em>The X-Files</em> occupies an important position. It wasn&#8217;t the first show to have survived thanks largely to the activism of a relatively small group of passionate fans &#8212; the original <em>Star Trek</em> leaps immediately to mind as a much earlier instance of same &#8212; but it was the first to be joined at the hip from the get-go with <em>Internet</em> fandom. In this sense, it was a harbinger of a new reality, in which almost every artifact of traditional media would have to adjust to a life spent in a symbiotic relationship with cyberspace.</p>
<p>Then, too, as I already noted, the mythology episodes paved the way for the Golden Age of Cable Television by serving as a demonstration of both the power of long-form storytelling on television and, less happily but no less usefully, of some of the ways it can go wrong. The conspiracy angle in <em>The X-Files</em> quickly became, to steal a phrase from the Cold War historian David Martin, a &#8220;wilderness of mirrors.&#8221; Partly this was down to aesthetic intent, but it was equally down to practical necessity. The only way to keep the conspiracy story arc going was to just keep putting more and more mirrors in the heroes&#8217; way. Later serialized shows &#8212; not all of them by any means, but a lot of them &#8212; would use more limited seasonal episode counts, or in some cases entire runs that were planned as limited from the start, to do better on this front. We should never forget that, in this respect as in a number of others, <em>The X-Files</em> was a pioneer, with few if any examples to follow; we therefore shouldn&#8217;t be overly surprised that it did so much wrong. Indeed, the media world into which it was born made it effectively impossible for it to do some of what shows like <em>The Sopranos</em> and <em>Breaking Bad</em> later did so well. In short, <em>The X-Files&#8217;</em>s creators played the cards they were dealt as well as they knew how, and there&#8217;s never any shame in that.</p>
<p>All that said, there does remain another sense in which <em>The X-Files</em> seems today less like a brave pioneer and more like one of the shadowy agents of evil who featured so prominently in so many of its episodes, and it&#8217;s this elephant in the room with which I feel sadly obliged to close this series of articles.</p>
<p>Chris Carter most definitely didn&#8217;t invent conspiracy theories; the roots of the modern fixation on evil cabals manipulating events behind the scenes can be traced back at least as far as 1903 and the infamous antisemitic forgery <em>The Protocols of the Elders of Zion</em>. Yet conspiracy theories have been weaponized in the years since <em>The X-Files</em> went off the air to a degree arguably not seen since the Nazis used them as a partial justification for the Holocaust. Carter himself was never a committed believer in UFO conspiracies; he saw them first and foremost as a cool set of ready-made fictions around which to build his show. Many or most fans of said show doubtless saw them the same way. But, by doing so much to break conspiracy culture into the American mainstream, <em>The X-Files</em> must shoulder some small portion of the blame for what seems to be an increasingly post-truth United States, where uncomfortable facts like electoral defeats can be hand-waved away with claims of voter fraud, where essential public-health measures like vaccines can be imagined to be agents of mind control, where people can convince themselves to kill in the cause of thwarting an international pedophile ring being run out of a Washington, D.C., pizza parlor, and where duly elected members of Congress can tell us that the current administration in the White House is attacking the parts of the country that it doesn&#8217;t like with bespoke hurricanes. This is the poison pill lurking behind that iconic poster hanging on Mulder&#8217;s wall. If everyone decides that just &#8220;wanting&#8221; to believe is justification enough for doing so, this world of ours is going to wind up in a very bad place. It strikes me as deeply unfortunate that, in all of its 218 episodes and two movies, <em>The X-Files</em> never saw fit to address the deeper psychological dilemma of such a smart man who would tack such a dumb poster to his wall. On the contrary, as late as the first revival season in 2016, the show was presenting in a fairly heroic light a conspiracy monger who is quite plainly based on Alex Jones of InfoWars, a pernicious huckster of dangerous, reactionary nonsense. In a recent survey of <em>X-Files</em> fan attitudes conducted by the academic researcher Bethan Jones, one anonymous respondent said that &#8220;I always thought of <em>The X-Files</em> in retrospective as an (incidental?) instrument [in] getting people to become paranoid of their government, which is an instrument of the real power to manipulate democracies.&#8221; This seems to me a fair assessment.</p>
<p>Of course, <em>The X-Files</em> is at the very worst a small proximate cause of the situation in which we find ourselves today. And yet even its tiny portion of the blame is enough to cast a faint shadow over any retrospective like this one. It took us a long time to go from the alien-autopsy film to QAnon, but it seems safe to say that <em>The X-Files</em> had a hand in propagating both of them. The best we can do now is hope the day will come when it can be remembered as just a groundbreaking television show again, with no further prevarication required. Until then, it will have to remain both a victim and a proof of a force that is more insidiously frightening than any alien invasion: the law of unintended consequences.</p>

<blockquote><p>If traditional film is a river, the viewer of that film sits on the bank and watches the water flow by. We wanted to take that viewer and turn them into a fish and put them down into that river.</p>
<p style="text-align: right;">&#8212; Greg Roach, Director of The X-Files Game</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Given the demographics of <em>X-Files</em> fandom, we probably shouldn&#8217;t be surprised that the show&#8217;s parent network Fox started to think about making a computer game that was officially based on it quite quickly. Already early in the second season, before the big breakthrough at the Golden Globe Awards, Fox began making inquiries on the subject with game developers. This was the peak of the interactive-movie era, when games that blended interactivity with video clips starring real human actors were widely believed to be the necessary future of the medium. Fox&#8217;s search thus led it to HyperBole Studios, a company whose name positively screams 1990s &#8212; note the sticky capital &#8220;B&#8221; in the middle of it &#8212; every bit as much as <em>The X-Files</em> itself. With a name like that, how could the studio be anything but a loud and proud advocate of the so-called &#8220;Siliwood&#8221; approach to game making?</p>
<p>HyperBole had actually been around for half a decade by that point, evolving alongside the hype over multimedia computing. It was the brainchild of one Greg Roach, who had gotten his first Apple IIc home computer in 1985, when he was still a university student majoring in theater and philosophy in Houston, Texas. He had tried to play the text adventures of the era, but found that they didn&#8217;t agree with him. What should have been &#8220;portals to a different world&#8221; struck him as balky, pedantic, and dull.</p>
<p>A few years later, when he was employed as an associate director at the Stages Repertory Theatre in Houston, he got his first glimpse of <a href="/2016/09/the-freedom-to-associate">HyperCard</a> on the Apple Macintosh. It was a revelation. &#8220;Here was the answer I&#8217;d been looking for,&#8221; he says. Like <a href="/2016/10/the-manhole">a lot of other starstruck HyperCard zealots</a> from unusual, often non-technical backgrounds, he founded a company to bring his hypertext experiments to the world. Initially, he did not envision HyperBole as anything so gauche as a games studio: it was rather to be the publisher of a bimonthly multimedia magazine on two floppy disks. The magazine never quite met that bimonthly schedule, but Roach and his friends did manage to put out nine issues between 1990 and 1992. Each was an eclectic mix of hypertext narratives, comics, visual art, video clips, poetry, and opinion pieces. &#8220;The writing can sometimes be a little idiosyncratic,&#8221; wrote <em>MacUser</em> of the endeavor, &#8220;but it&#8217;s never boring.&#8221; The magazine&#8217;s most ambitious project was <em>The Madness of Roland</em>, an &#8220;interactive novel&#8221; by Roach himself that ran in installments in the first six issues. Sprouting from <em>The Song of Roland</em>, the towering Medieval epic about a chivalrous knight-errant in the time of <a href="https://analog-antiquarian.net/2023/04/14/chapter-2-a-holy-roman-emperor/">Charlemagne</a>, it quickly evolved &#8212; or devolved, depending on your point of view &#8212; into a stream-of-consciousness postmodern pastiche of the sort that was <a href="/2017/02/the-eastgate-school-of-serious-hypertext">very popular</a> among academic hypertext theorists at the time. It was eventually released in an enhanced version as <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/game/204245/the-madness-of-roland/">a standalone product</a>.</p>
<p>The hard truth was, however, that work like this was more interesting to the literary theorists than it was to ordinary computer owners; you certainly weren&#8217;t going to be able to sustain a software company of any real size on it, not even one that catered to the artsy, well-heeled Mac user base. Being a man with commercial as well as intellectual aspirations, Roach decided to add <a href="/2016/09/a-slow-motion-revolution">the revolutionary new storage medium of CD-ROM</a> to his technological stack and replace interactive books with interactive movies. He ended the magazine and moved to Seattle, both to be closer to the West Coast tech titans and to take advantage of the city&#8217;s underrated theater and film- and video-production communities. No shrinking violet, he branded himself &#8220;the Spielberg of multimedia&#8221; and &#8220;a theorist of virtual cinema,&#8221; and commenced cold-calling anyone who would pick up the telephone. For example, he talked his way into sharing a stage with <a href="/tag/meier/?order=asc">Sid Meier</a> for a debate over &#8220;Multimedia versus Game Design&#8221; at the 1994 Computer Game Developers Conference, where he discussed the importance of things like &#8220;a geometric understanding of the spatial possibilities of what the media represents.&#8221; (Such tangled phraseology left Meier scratching his head; he kept trying to bring the conversation back around to the best ways of making games that were, you know, fun.)</p>
<p>Roach charmed enough venture capitalists to hire some programmers, who helped him to create a system for making interactive movies called, naturally enough, VirtualCinema. In another tribute to his energy and persuasiveness, HyperBole became the first games studio to be signed by Hollywood&#8217;s Agency for the Performing Arts &#8212; the most prestigious talent agency in Tinseltown &#8212; as a client.</p>
<p>The first of HyperBole&#8217;s VirtualCinema games was one of the last to be published by a shady outfit called <a href="/2021/11/boffo-games">Media Vision</a>, which had gotten its start in sound cards and was now attempting to build a larger empire on boxed games of its own and, wherever and whenever these failed to deliver the goods, lots and lots of accounting fraud. According to Roach &#8212; admittedly, not always the most reliable witness &#8212; Media Vision yanked a half-completed interactive movie out of his hands and rushed it onto store shelves when the financial house of cards began to show signs of instability. Be that as it may, the game called <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/game/3956/quantum-gate/"><em>Quantum Gate</em></a> was followed just nine months later by one called <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/game/4423/the-vortex-quantum-gate-ii/"><em>The Vortex: Quantum Gate II</em> </a>that picked up right where it had left off. By that time, however, the house of cards at Media Vision had collapsed, so the sequel was published by HyperBole themselves. As a result, it had little retail presence and sold hardly any copies at all.</p>
<p>If nothing else, these games served to prove the wisdom of the move to Seattle; in terms of their acting performances and overall production values, they really did stand out from most of the sub-B-movie competition in their space. Unfortunately, Roach&#8217;s scripts were less impressive, being a nearly incomprehensible mishmash of science-fiction clichés and New Age malarkey. The interactivity wasn&#8217;t up to much either: just some deserted corridors to wander from a <a href="/2020/02/myst-or-the-drawbacks-to-success"><em>Myst</em>-style</a> first-person perspective, some menus that popped up in conversations but made minimal difference to the larger arc of the story, and, most lamentably and inexplicably of all, a thoroughly botched attempt to re-implement the old arcade classic <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/game/360/battlezone/"><em>Battlezone</em></a>.</p>
<p>Despite their shortcomings, the <em>Quantum Gate</em> games wound up serving HyperBole well after a fashion. For when Fox started looking around for someone to make an <em>X-Files</em> game, HyperBole&#8217;s Hollywood talent agency could submit them as demo reels. Roach claimed in 1998 that, upon being formally invited to submit a bid for the project, he almost turned the opportunity down: &#8220;I&#8217;d never seen <em>The X-Files</em> at that point. But then I watched the show. The creative possibilities were intriguing, so we went back to Fox and affirmed our interest.&#8221;</p>
<p>It soon became clear that the idea of an <em>X-Files </em>game was being driven by the suits at Fox, not by the team that was in the trenches making the television show from week to week. Chris Carter was at best ambivalent. &#8220;What can you do that I can&#8217;t?&#8221; he asked Roach at their first meeting. Slowly, Roach talked him around, at the same time that he convinced his bosses at Fox that the VirtualCinema engine was just the tool for the job. Eventually, Carter agreed to provide a story outline which HyperBole would then turn into a game. By the end of 1995, when the show was in the midst of its third season, the deal was done. Barely three years removed from making an underground multimedia magazine in his basement for a few hundred subscribers, Roach was now to be entrusted with one of the hottest properties on television, watched by tens of millions of people every week. Truly these were strange times in gaming.</p>
<p>That said, it wasn&#8217;t going to be practical to build the entire game around Mulder and Scully; David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson were busy enough as it was. At the same time, though, any alleged <em>X-Files</em> game from which they were completely absent would surely be pilloried. Carter&#8217;s story outline rather cleverly solved the problem by giving the player control of another, newly introduced FBI agent by the name of Craig Willmore, who would be set on the trail of the usual twosome after they mysteriously disappeared in the middle of an investigation. Duchovny and Anderson would appear only near the end of the game, as the player&#8217;s reward for getting that far. All things considered, it seemed like a reasonable compromise.</p>
<p>After much fraught negotiations with the two stars&#8217; representatives, it was agreed that they would come to Seattle for about a week to film their scenes. Mitch Pileggi, who played Assistant Director Walter Skinner, Mulder and Scully&#8217;s immediate superior at the FBI, signed on as well. Ditto the actors who played The Lone Gunmen, a trio of eccentric computer hackers who helped Mulder and Scully out from time to time on the show. Even William B. Davis, otherwise known as Cancer Man, agreed to a cameo appearance.</p>

Davis.</p></div>
<p>Getting all of this arranged took months and months. &#8220;Working with a company like Fox is a lot like talking to a person with multiple-personality disorder or Alzheimer&#8217;s,&#8221; says Roach. &#8220;They never remember from one minute to the next what they&#8217;ve agreed to. We had to deal with the legal division, marketing department, Fox Interactive, the TV division, and Chris Carter. Each of them has their own fiefdom and their own veto capacity that only extends so far in certain areas.&#8221; Most creative decisions required the approval of Carter, but it was made all too clear by his average response time to queries that the <em>X-Files</em> game was not high on his priority list. In all, another year and a half went by before the design document, script, and all of the assorted acting contracts were far enough along that shooting could begin.</p>
<p>This milestone coincided with the end of the show&#8217;s fourth season, when it was nearing the absolute pinnacle of its popularity and cultural cachet. A typical 24-episode season was shot at a pace of roughly one episode every ten days, meaning that Duchovny and Anderson could expect to spend a good two-thirds of each year playing Mulder and Scully. This year they were even busier, however, because an <em>X-Files</em> feature film was to be shot between the fourth and fifth seasons, to premiere in movie theaters right after the latter had finished airing. And on top of all this, the two were now expected to come to Seattle during the two-week gap between the fourth-season wrap party and the beginning of work on the film in order to help Greg Roach get his computer game done. Understandably enough under the circumstances, they arrived tired and decidedly unenthusiastic. Because of the scheduling issues, Mulder and Scully&#8217;s scenes were to be filmed first &#8212; a true baptism by fire for the cast and crew. &#8220;After that, the rest of the shoot seemed relatively easy,&#8221; says Roach.</p>
<p>Duchovny, who had aspirations of becoming a Hollywood leading man of the sort who could carry a major non-<em>X-Files </em>film on his own, had been growing restless on the television show of late. It isn&#8217;t hard to imagine what he thought of the notion of appearing in a videogame, a still less respected medium than television. HyperBole did their best to make him happy, even going so far as to place a private yoga instructor at his beck and call throughout his stay in Seattle. Nonetheless, he did the bare minimum required of him during the time he was contractually obligated to make himself available, then jetted off without a backward glance to enjoy what was left of his holiday.</p>
<div id="attachment_6121" style="width: 431px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://www.filfre.net/2024/10/the-truth-is-out-there-part-3-the-game-of-belief/roach/" rel="attachment wp-att-6121"><img decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-6121" class="wp-image-6121 size-full" src="https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/roach.jpg" alt="" width="421" height="354" srcset="https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/roach.jpg 421w, https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/roach-300x252.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 421px) 100vw, 421px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-6121" class="wp-caption-text">Greg Roach directs David Duchovny.</p></div>
<p>Gillian Anderson, on the other hand, went above and beyond the call of duty. Once the concept of the game was explained to her, she became genuinely interested in what HyperBole was trying to do, and put in a lot more effort than she needed to. She even agreed to stay on a few extra days after Duchovny left, to shoot some extra scenes that Greg Roach hastily wrote to take advantage of her unexpected graciousness. &#8220;I like the Four Seasons hotel in Seattle,&#8221; she said as a way of deflecting everyone&#8217;s gratitude. If you&#8217;ve played the game, you probably noticed that you see a lot more of Scully in it than Mulder. Now you know why.</p>
<p>The entirety of the filming took seven weeks, all of them spent at locations in and around Seattle. A goodly chunk of the crew&#8217;s time was spent at the old Naval Station Puget Sound at Sand Point, a Navy base and airfield &#8212; the first airborne circumnavigation of the Earth had ended there in 1924 &#8212; that had recently been decommissioned as part of the peace dividend for winning the Cold War. It was in every way a classic <em>X-Files</em> set. &#8220;It had to be big, it had to be scary, it had to be a Byzantine maze with corridors and machinery,&#8221; says Roach. &#8220;At Sand Point, they&#8217;d built a new brig, and then a year later the base was shut down. So we had this huge, brand spanking new, governmental, high-tech facility that provided the perfect shell for the secret base.&#8221; The local maritime training academy and its primary training ship, formerly an ocean-going icebreaker and tug, were more thoroughly <em>X-Files</em>-looking places. All were shown to maximum advantage, thanks not least to Director of Photography Jon Joffin, who had held the same title for eleven episodes of the television show during its fourth season. He became known as &#8220;the smoke Nazi&#8221; around HyperBole for his ability to conjure up that trademark <em>X-Files</em> murk.</p>
<p>Once the filming wrapped, it was back to the office for the HyperBole principals. There they used the VirtualCinema system to turn the video footage that had been shot, along with still photographs of the various locations, into a game. As this work proceeded and the likely timeline for its completion firmed up, Fox decided how to incorporate the game into its marketing plans for <em>The X-Files</em> in general. The summer of 1998 was already to be The Summer of <em>The X-Files</em>; a shocking, bravura finale to the fifth season on May 17 would lead right into the movie hitting theaters on June 19. The game seemed a nice adjunct to these plans; indeed, it was decided that it should be released on the very same day as the movie&#8217;s premiere. To emphasize its kinship with what most people were calling &#8220;the <em>X-Files</em> movie&#8221; &#8212; its official name was just <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120902"><em>The X-Files</em></a> &#8212; Fox Interactive branded HyperBole&#8217;s effort simply <em>The X-Files Game</em>, which was certainly descriptive if not very original.</p>
<div id="attachment_6119" style="width: 610px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://www.filfre.net/2024/10/the-truth-is-out-there-part-3-the-game-of-belief/anderson/" rel="attachment wp-att-6119"><img decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-6119" class="wp-image-6119" src="https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Anderson-300x199.webp" alt="" width="600" height="398" srcset="https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Anderson-300x199.webp 300w, https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Anderson.webp 736w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-6119" class="wp-caption-text">Gillian Anderson further endeared herself to Fox Interactive and HyperBole by agreeing to come to the E3 trade show in May of 1998 to sign autographs and promote the soon-to-be-released game.</p></div>
<p>When June 19 arrived, those eager fans who stopped by a software store on their way to or from their friendly local movieplex got, alongside more <em>X-Files</em> than was probably good for anyone in such a compressed span of time, a game that was exceptional in some ways but ultimately unable to overcome the limitations of its format. By 1998, those limitations were already causing the games industry to move sharply away from the interactive-movie conceit and all it entailed. The appearance of <em>The X-Files Game</em> this late in the day was more a tribute to its long gestation time and the power of licensing than any strong demand for more games of this type in the marketplace. In fact, <em>The X-Files Game</em> was the very last splashy production of its kind to hit store shelves, the last gasp of a confused but earnest movement in game development that really had once seemed like the future of the medium writ large. (Three other stragglers of the same breed &#8212; <a href="/2024/06/the-journeyman-project"><em>The Journeyman Project 3</em></a>, <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/game/1174/black-dahlia/"><em>Black Dahlia</em></a>, and <a href="/2024/08/tex-murphy-and-the-coming-of-the-dvd-a-shaggy-dog-story"><em>Tex Murphy: Overseer</em></a> &#8212; had shown up earlier in 1998.) Game developers like Greg Roach and HyperBole, who had irrevocably married themselves to the idea of a grand alliance between Silicon Valley and Hollywood, would find themselves out of a job going forward. One can only hope that it was fun for them while it lasted.</p>
<p>As the last of its kind, <em>The X-Files Game</em> ought to be an exceptional example, the highest iteration of the interactive-movie conception. And in some ways at least, it really is. It sprawls across no fewer than seven CDs. That space is used for video that looks far better than the norm &#8212; almost, dare I say it, of DVD quality.</p>
<p>The live-action segments also impress in ways that transcend mere audiovisual fidelity. Their production values are superb by comparison with almost any other interactive movie. They make no use of green-screening: the practice of painting pixel-arts &#8220;sets&#8221; in behind human actors who have said their lines on empty sound stages, an approach which was used in the vast majority of other games of this type because it was much, much cheaper than filming on proper sets. Roach claims that it cost $6 million in the final reckoning to make <em>The X-Files Game</em>. A good chunk of the budget was doubtless swallowed up by the complicated corporate logistics of the project; David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson would soon be signing contract extensions on the television show that paid them six-digit sums for every single episode they appeared in, and one has to assume the salaries they were paid to appear here were comparable if not even more excessive. Still, there&#8217;s no denying that this game <em>looks</em> as good as any typical episode of the show. It genuinely feels like <em>The X-Files</em>. Of course, it helped to shoot in Seattle, a city whose climate is much the same as that of gray-and-rainy Vancouver, its neighbor just on the other side of the border to its north.</p>
<p>The acting here acquits itself reasonably well too. Yes, Duchovny looks a little bored and irritated, but Anderson is fine in a role whose tics and mannerisms she has down flat, as is Mitch Pileggi. The unfamiliar actors who are expected to carry the balance of the game don&#8217;t do much if any worse than your typical guest star on the show. Jordan Lee Williams, who plays Agent Craig Willmore, carries out his ersatz Mulder assignment about as well as one can ask. Ditto Paige Witte, who plays the Seattle police detective who becomes Willmore&#8217;s partner in investigation, his equivalent of Scully.</p>
<p>Alas, the part of <em>The X-Files Game</em> that is supposed to put the &#8220;interactive&#8221; in an interactive movie is less impressive and more problematic. Before I get to that, though, I do need to note that one accusation which has been repeatedly leveled against this game from just after its release right up until the present day actually isn&#8217;t fair at all. When you first arrive at the Seattle FBI office as Agent Willmore, you need to log into your computer, which in turns requires a password. Lackadaisical reviewers have been writing for decades now that you&#8217;re expected to guess this password from Willmore&#8217;s enthusiasm for the history of the American Civil War and a whole lot of lateral thinking. This would indeed be an awful puzzle to start (or end) any game with, not to mention nonsensical in terms of verisimilitude. (You&#8217;re supposed to <em>be</em> Willmore, after all. Why would he need to puzzle out his own password?) But it&#8217;s not a puzzle: the password you need is written in the manual. The fact that this caused such confusion is itself a sign of changing times in gaming. Just a few years before <em>The X-Files Game</em>, gamers were poring over manuals as a matter of course; by a few years after, manuals had all but disappeared. This game found itself caught in the middle, making assumptions about its player base that no longer held true.</p>
<p>In reality, the problems here don&#8217;t come down to nonsensical puzzles. Greg Roach never had much interest in puzzles anyway, and, even if he would have, Fox had made it clear that this product must be accessible to people who had never played a computer game before, who were attracted strictly by the name of the television show on the box. All of which means that, although <em>The X-Files Game</em> plays superficially like a <em>Myst</em> clone when you aren&#8217;t watching video clips or clicking through dialog trees, it can&#8217;t offer up the usual array of arbitrary set-piece puzzles to gate your progress. And that&#8217;s a fine, even welcome development in itself; Lord knows, we had all seen enough slider puzzles to last a lifetime by this point. Yet it gradually becomes clear that neither Roach nor anyone else at HyperBole has anything to hand with which to replace arbitrary puzzles. This investigation turns out to require shockingly little thought on your part. Go where the game wants you to go and click on everything there. Rinse and repeat, and in due course you win.</p>
<p>Now, even this isn&#8217;t awful in itself. There is plenty of room in my heart for a game that&#8217;s not really interested in challenging me, that just wants to sweep me away on the wings of an exciting story. But there are two more downfalls here. One has a remedy; sadly, the other does not.</p>
<p>The first is the &#8220;clicking on everything&#8221; part of the equation. <em>The X-Files Game</em> may have decided to abandon arbitrary puzzles and to replace pre-rendered 3D scenes with carefully shot photographs, but it still has all the other infelicities of the <em>Myst</em>-style first-person, node-based approach to navigation. You never know quite where all you can look, and your degree of rotation when you turn is wildly inconsistent from node to node. It&#8217;s disarmingly easy to get confused just trying to weave your way through the FBI office. And when the game sends you off to a sprawling warehouse with darkened nooks and crannies everywhere&#8230; oh, my. Here you have to scour every single node and viewpoint for the tiny pieces of evidence that you need to collect to jog the plot wheels back into motion. There&#8217;s nothing fun about this. It makes the game hard in the most annoying of all possible ways; I&#8217;ll take slider puzzles any day over fake mazes and pixel hunts.</p>
<p>Thankfully, the game does give you a way of avoiding most of these stumbling blocks. You can turn on something called &#8220;Artificial Intuition&#8221; to gain access to a hint system and, most importantly, activate an icon that will swirl suggestively whenever you&#8217;re &#8220;in close proximity to information vital to the investigation.&#8221; I advise you to spare yourself a world of frustration by taking advantage of it.</p>
<p>But my other overarching complaint has no similar remedy. It goes to the story itself, which is&#8230; well, it&#8217;s just not that good, certainly not good enough to maintain the player&#8217;s interest in the absence of compelling gameplay. Greg Roach&#8217;s script from Chris Carter&#8217;s story outline is most kindly described as workmanlike &#8212; <em>X-Files</em> by the numbers, without the flashes of subversive wit and human warmth that marked the television series&#8217;s best episodes.</p>
<p>There are linchpins of the plot that just don&#8217;t make much sense. When you finally locate Scully, you learn that she&#8217;s been cooling her heels for several days in a sanitarium &#8212; a perfectly innocent one, that is, not <a href="/2024/08/sanitarium">the type you can&#8217;t check out of</a> &#8212; without bothering to tell anyone at the FBI where she is. Meanwhile Mulder has gone charging off on the trail of yet another government conspiracy involving aliens without ever bothering to tell his partner what he&#8217;s up to, much less the agency that employs him. Even by the usual standards of these two, that&#8217;s some terrible communication.</p>
<p>Other weaknesses are inherent to the very nature of the project. <em>The X-Files Game</em> was always destined to be a bit player in the larger <em>X-Files</em> saga. The &#8220;Mulder and Scully have been kidnapped!&#8221; plot tries its best to get you invested, but these are, after all, the two most incompetent agents at the FBI, who rush heedlessly into danger and nearly get themselves killed every single week. We know perfectly well the game isn&#8217;t going to let them die, as we also know that nothing all that important to the larger mythology of the show is going to be revealed by this ancillary production. The stakes never feel very high because we&#8217;ve seen all of this so many times before. In the <em>X-Files</em> movie, Scully is kidnapped and Mulder must effect a rescue; once you find Scully here, it becomes a mirror image of that scenario. And so, as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NEkJhBHh54">Joni Mitchell sang</a>, it&#8217;s &#8220;round and round and round in the circle game.&#8221;</p>
<p>The date which appears onscreen at the opening of the game places it in the past of the current <em>X-Files</em> chronology at the time the game was released: all the way back in the third season, which was, not coincidentally, the season during which Chris Carter wrote the story outline. At that time, the mythology episodes were revolving around the &#8220;black oil,&#8221; a kind of parasitic alien consciousness that could infect human hosts and take them over, <em>Invasion of the Body Snatchers</em>-style. But that plot line had long since been put to bed by the time the fifth season rolled around, the better to make way for the latest existential threat to humanity. Here, however, we&#8217;re mired in the stuff once again, in a way that must have felt painfully anticlimactic to those hardcore <em>X-Files</em> fans who rushed out to pick up the game upon its release.</p>
<p>In lieu of a plot that goes anywhere particularly interesting, the script dangles the promise of meeting Mulder and Scully in the flesh as the most tangible reward for slogging through the mazes and pixel hunts. From a certain perspective, this was clever. But it doesn&#8217;t do anything to make <em>The X-Files</em><em> Game</em> a game that can stand on its own, divorced from the television show that spawned it. Quite the opposite, in fact.</p>

<p>Agent Willmore in full jerk mode. Meeting an Asian man near a potential crime scene, he immediately leaps to questioning his immigration status. And then&#8230; what accent? Although <em>The X-Files Game</em> acquits itself well on some fronts, it&#8217;s full of little inconsistencies like these that mark it as not quite ready for prime time. (&#8220;James Wong,&#8221; by the way, is the name of a regular <em>X-Files</em> scriptwriter, responsible for the early standout episode <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0751141">&#8220;Ice&#8221;</a> among many others.)</p>

The last disc of of <em>The X-Files Game</em> is a fine example of this. It ought to be a series of heart-pounding action sequences, but, because the only things the game can show you are things that have been filmed, it turns instead into a tedious exercise in figuring out what sequence of events were written down beforehand in the script. Doing anything else leads to a summary judgment of instant death for the crime of failing to read the scriptwriter&#8217;s mind.</p></div>

As if the anachronistic quality of its interactive-movie conceit hadn&#8217;t been problem enough, the commercial prospects of <em>The X-Files Game</em> were badly damaged by yet another factor. It had been Fox Interactive and HyperBole&#8217;s intention all along to release the game in June of 1998 not only for Windows and the Mac, but also in a version for the Sony PlayStation. Doing so would have broadened its potential customer base almost exponentially. But, lacking expertise on the more constrained, finicky console, HyperBole made the fateful decision to outsource the port to a third party, who rewarded their faith by dropping the ball entirely. There was no alternative but to release on computers only and then try to do the PlayStation port in-house. Thanks to heroic efforts on the part of their programmers, HyperBole did get it done, delivering a port that doesn&#8217;t look or play all that much worse than the computer versions &#8212; a remarkable feat indeed, considering the disparities of hardware involved. Yet it took them until well into 1999 to get it ready, by which time the game only seemed like that much more of an anachronism.</p>
<p>Despite it all, Greg Roach claims that <em>The X-Files Game</em> sold &#8220;in the region of&#8221; 1 million copies when all was said and done. I suppose that such a figure isn&#8217;t completely out of the bounds of possibility when the console version and bargain bins are taken into account; the PlayStation had such mass popularity and market penetration at this time that a turd in a box with the Sony logo on it would probably have shifted a few hundred thousand units. Whatever the real numbers, though, there was never any serious talk during the remainder of the television show&#8217;s run of funding another <em>X-Files</em> game, of the interactive-movie or any other style, made by HyperBole or anyone else. This alone is ample evidence that the first game wasn&#8217;t a rip-roaring success.</p>
<p>The cultural moment that could spawn studios like HyperBole was well and truly past by 1998; the company never won another contract of anywhere close to this one&#8217;s prominence and size, in fact never made another boxed computer game of any sort. A downsized HyperBole subsisted on small Web-development contracts and the like for a while, before closing up shop for good in 2005.</p>
<p>By that time, Greg Roach was well on the way to his next big thing. He says that he experienced a &#8220;tremendously powerful spiritual awakening&#8221; in 1998, when he celebrated shipping <em>The X-Files</em><em> Game</em> with a trip to Egypt to see <a href="https://analog-antiquarian.net/2019/01/11/chapter-1-the-charlatan-and-the-gossip/">the Pyramids of Giza</a>. There he was contacted by a group of trans-dimensional beings of pure energy whom he has come to call the Council of Light. (He adopted this appellation after his first name for them, the White Brotherhood, proved to have all the wrong connotations.) The shuttering of HyperBole coincided with his founding of Spirit Quest Tours, offering &#8220;life-changing spiritual travel&#8221; to those who, like Fox Mulder, really, really Want to Believe. As of this writing, you can find enlightenment for twelve days in Peru for just $7950, not including airfare, meals, single supplement, or &#8220;personal expenses.&#8221; Nobody ever said that The Truth Out There would come cheap.</p>

<blockquote><p>When I was sitting in my office in my surf trunks, barefoot, playing ball with the dog every twenty minutes, writing the pilot for The X-Files, I never imagined that they would be making X-Files underwear and that 10,000 people a week would be logging onto the Internet to talk about the show&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align: right;">&#8212; Chris Carter, 1995</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Chris Carter, the creator of <em>The X-Files</em>, couldn&#8217;t have been more different from your stereotypical scrawny, pasty-skinned, basement-dwelling conspiracy theorist. Born in 1956 in a suburb of Los Angeles, he was more like your stereotypical beach bum, who learned to surf almost before he learned to walk. Upon graduating from university with a degree in journalism, he went to work for <em>Surfing</em> magazine, rising to the post of senior editor while still in his mid-twenties. &#8220;I went around the world surfing,&#8221; he says. It was in every way a charmed life for a young man.</p>
<p>Not long after getting married in 1983, however, he started to think about finding a less travel-intensive career, one that might be able to sustain him even after his hardcore surfing days were behind him. He decided to try his hand at screenwriting; he was certainly living in the right part of the world for it, after all. And once again, he proved lucky or talented at his chosen profession &#8212; or, more likely, both. He broke into the business in remarkably short order, writing scripts for various TV movies along with other piecework. His longest-lasting gig was in the writers&#8217; room of <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0092434"><em>Rags to Riches</em></a>, a quirky but wholesome hybrid of musical, sitcom, and family drama that ran for two seasons on NBC in 1987 and 1988. Such light-hearted, borderline saccharine material gave no hint that he had something like <em>The X-Files</em> in him. &#8220;I actually became known as a comedy writer,&#8221; he says. &#8220;That&#8217;s what people kept wanting me to write.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a longstanding truism in television that every workaday writer in the field dreams secretly &#8212; or not so secretly &#8212; of having a show all his own. Chris Carter was no exception. He thought his best chance of fulfilling his dream lay at Rupert Murdoch&#8217;s new Fox network, an upstart that was trying to claw out a space for itself alongside CBS, NBC, and ABC, the Big Three in American broadcast television ever since the era of the idiot box began. Fox had enjoyed its greatest success to date with programming that was a little too edgy for the stodgier established networks, but which the advertiser-coveted younger demographics adored. Shows like the rapier-witted adult-oriented cartoon <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0096697"><em>The Simpsons</em></a> and the decidedly non-wholesome family sitcom <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0092400"><em>Married&#8230; with Children</em></a> were the necessary antidote to NBC&#8217;s sugary-sweet <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0086687"><em>Cosby Show</em></a>, the biggest program of all on American television. Carter thought that a horror series might fit in well with the Fox lineup.</p>
<p>As has been recounted many times over the years since, the inspiration that started Carter down the road to <em>The X-Files</em> was a television obscurity from 1974, a series called <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0071003"><em>Kolchak: The Night Stalker</em> </a>that had been allowed just one season of twenty episodes on ABC before it was cancelled. Despite its short run, its tales of a lone Chicago journalist exploring an underworld of vampires, werewolves, and other things that go bump in the night, whilst dealing with an almost equally unfriendly city government that didn&#8217;t want any of his horrifying discoveries to come to light, had struck a deep chord in the young Chris Carter. &#8220;Basically, I just wanted to do something as scary as I remembered <em>The Night Stalker</em> being when I was in my teens,&#8221; he says. &#8220;I remembered being scared out of my wits by that show as a kid, and I realized that there just wasn&#8217;t anything scary now on television.&#8221; It seemed like a gap that Fox, which reveled in boundary-pushing content, might be thrilled to fill.</p>
<p>There were no aliens in <em>The Night Stalker</em>, nor in Carter&#8217;s earliest vision of <em>The X-Files</em>. Soon enough, though, a friend clued him into the underground world of ufology. Perusing the reams of poorly xeroxed newsletters, badly dubbed videocassettes, and obscure Usenet newsgroups that were the loosely organized cult&#8217;s primary means of communication, Carter realized that here was a whole ready-made milieu and mythology for his show, which could make it more than just a series of one-off encounters with the creepy and paranormal. For he wasn&#8217;t such a fan of <em>The Night Stalker</em> that he couldn&#8217;t see its limitations: &#8220;I think having a &#8216;monster of the week&#8217; reduced the longevity of its storytelling capabilities.&#8221;</p>
<p>Soap operas had been indulging in long story arcs that spanned many episodes or even seasons for decades. Other genres of shows, however, had generally felt compelled to return the situation to a status quo at the end of every episode. Only recently had that begun to change. Still unsure how much they could get away with asking of their audience, most shows that were experimenting with longer story arcs were hedging their bets by mixing them up with more traditional, strictly episodic storytelling. <em>The X-Files</em> would be no exception. It would wind up producing &#8220;mythology&#8221; episodes about the alien menace only about one-quarter to one-third of the time, then rounding out the rest of its seasons with mostly self-contained &#8220;monster of the week&#8221; episodes.</p>
<p>The truth or fiction of the conspiracy theories from which Carter borrowed so liberally was not so much unknown as irrelevant to him. A child of the Watergate era for whom distrust of authority came naturally, he was drawn to write aliens into his show for the same reason that, one has to suspect, so many other people were writing newsletters about them: because they felt so simultaneously dangerous and alluring, in such marked contrast to most government scandals. Whatever else you could say about them, the Roswell crash, flying saucers, alien abductions, and the government coverups surrounding them all were a hell of a lot more fun than <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran%E2%80%93Contra_affair">the Iran-Contra affair</a>, the current White House&#8217;s scandal <em>du jour</em>.</p>
<p>As if that wasn&#8217;t grounds enough, Carter also had good reason to believe that the presence of aliens would make it easier to sell <em>The X-Files</em> to the suits at Fox. In the fall of 1991, just as he was beginning to put his pitch together, Fox debuted a program called <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0103549"><em>Sightings</em></a>, at first as a series of sporadically appearing specials. When these became unexpectedly popular, it was turned into a regularly scheduled weekly show in April of 1992, &#8220;investigating&#8221; all of the usual suspects: crop circles, cattle mutilations, alien-abduction accounts, and of course Roswell. <em>Sightings</em> was, in other words, the seed from which eventually sprang the alien-autopsy &#8220;documentary&#8221; &#8212; the start of a thriving cottage industry of cheaply made pseudo-documentaries dealing with aliens, conspiracies, and the paranormal that carefully avoided making claims to incontrovertible Truth but that always displayed a bias toward the believers&#8217; rather than the skeptics&#8217; side of the ledger. &#8220;Marketed correctly, these productions managed to be simultaneously authentic and phony, news and anti-news, without that feeling like any kind of contradiction,&#8221; writes television historian Emily Nussbaum. A scripted show dealing with the same subject matter, thought Chris Carter, might do even better.</p>
<p>Any such program could all too easily have become as kitschy and ephemeral as the likes of <em>Sightings</em>. It was the range of other influences which Carter brought to bear on <em>The X-Files</em> that would allow the show to transcend its humble origins, to become a shaper of the zeitgeist rather than a mere symptom of it. All were unusual to see on network television of the time: the Universal monster movies of the 1930s; film noir of the 1940s; the sci-fi B-movies of the 1950s; the cinéma vérité documentaries of the 1960s; the cynical post-Watergate conspiracy thrillers of the 1970s. To this list can be added blockbuster movies like <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0075860"><em>Close Encounters of the Third Kind</em></a> and <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0102926"><em>The Silence of the Lambs</em></a> (<em>The X-Files</em> liked its serial killers almost as much as it did aliens), and especially <a href="/2018/11/controlling-the-spice-part-1-dune-on-page-and-screen">David Lynch&#8217;s</a> heavily serialized, surrealistic television series <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0098936"><em>Twin Peaks</em></a>, which in its eight-episode first season in 1990 seemed to demonstrate that you could get away with asking a great deal indeed of your audience before it fell off the tightrope it had been walking and tumbled messily to earth during season two. Additionally, the television critic and historian Emily St. James makes a case for the influence of, of all things, the romantic &#8220;dramedy&#8221; series <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0088571"><em>Moonlighting</em></a>, which had a habit of upending all of its own formulas and indulging its experimental side for entire episodes at a time, taking &#8220;sidelong swerves into absurdism.&#8221; (I think St. James makes a reasonable case, although I do also think that these qualities are more in evidence a bit later in <em>The X-Files&#8217;</em>s run than they are at the beginning.)</p>
<p>As it evolved in its creator&#8217;s mind, <em>The X-Files</em> came to center on a tiny branch of the FBI whose assigned beat is &#8220;unusual&#8221; &#8212; read, apparently paranormal &#8212; cases. The two agents assigned to the branch were to be named Fox Mulder &#8212; the sort of name that could exist only in fiction, whose first part was an apparent homage to the network that would hopefully deign to permit him to exist &#8212; and Dana Scully. It was hardly unusual in network television at the time to throw an attractive man and woman together in a working relationship replete with will-they-or-won&#8217;t-they sexual tension &#8212; see the aforementioned <em>Moonlighting</em> &#8212; but Carter did defy gender stereotypes by making the male Mulder the credulous member of the pair and the female Scully the hard-eyed skeptic. Together, they would take on the sorts of cases that none of their colleagues would touch, which would often place them in conflict with shadowy forces inside their own government and their own agency who would prefer that any Truth that happened to be Out There remain hidden.</p>
<p>In December of 1992, Fox gave Carter a fine Christmas present indeed by ordering a pilot episode of the show. Now the pace increased exponentially.</p>
<p>And now Chris Carter got very, very lucky, by finding two stars for his show that were absolutely perfect. &#8220;We lucked out getting the chemistry we did,&#8221; he says. If anything, this is understating the case. For it really is difficult to overstate how important David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson were to <em>The X-Files&#8217;</em>s success. They were the special sauce that the show&#8217;s imitators would never be able to duplicate.</p>

<p>The 32-year-old David Duchovny, who earned the part of Fox Mulder, was an up-and-comer in Hollywood who was then best known for <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0103522"><em>Red Shoe Diaries</em></a>, a soft-core erotic series of the sort that flourished on late-night cable television in those days before the Internet <a href="/2023/11/a-digital-pornutopia-part-2-the-internet-is-for-porn">put pornography on tap for everyone at the click of a mouse</a>. He was almost scarily good-looking, the living embodiment of the phrase &#8220;tall, dark, and handsome,&#8221; but his secret weapon was his way with a desert-dry one-liner that undercut his Homecoming King face and figure. Like the character he played, Duchovny was smart as well as beautiful. He had been hard at work on a Yale PhD in English literature when he had stumbled into a casting call for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JYuI7n7X_U">a beer commercial</a> at age 27 and emerged with a full-blown case of the acting bug.</p>
<p>The <em>X-Files</em> writing staff would have great fun with the contradictions in Duchovny&#8217;s alter ego in the years to come, making Mulder a guy who lived from paycheck to paycheck in a shabby little apartment, with no social life and no women in his orbit beyond his platonic partner Scully &#8212; unless you counted the actresses who starred in the pornography that, it would be slyly hinted more and more, he consumed voraciously when not trolling the Internet for tales of alien abductions. Many an <em>X-Files</em> guest star would shake his head that a guy who looked like <em>that</em> could live like <em>this</em>. Duchovny himself, whose choice of projects before and after <em>The X-Files</em> make it clear that he wasn&#8217;t afraid of indulging the id, kind of thought the same. &#8220;I&#8217;d like to see Mulder die one day,&#8221; he said once to a journalist. &#8220;Not soon, but one day. He should get laid, and then die.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.filfre.net/2024/09/the-truth-is-out-there-part-2-the-power-of-belief/scully/" rel="attachment wp-att-6092"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-6092" src="https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/scully-300x169.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="338" srcset="https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/scully-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/scully-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/scully.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<p>Gillian Anderson, who was cast as Dana Scully, was even less experienced than her counterpart, being just 24 years old at the time, newly arrived in Hollywood with a freshly minted acting degree from DePaul University and only a few theatrical credits to her name as a professional. A certain superficial resemblance to Jodie Foster, who had played a young FBI agent in <em>The Silence of the Lambs</em>, may very well have been a factor in her casting. Even if so, though, she quickly proved herself to be much more than just another pretty face. Granted, she was a bit stiff on occasion in the early episodes &#8212; the other cast and crew speak tactfully of a &#8220;learning curve&#8221; on the set for this actress who had hardly ever stood before a camera before &#8212; but she would find her groove as Scully soon enough. Gender dynamics being what they are, it would have been easy for the relentlessly logical and scientific Scully to come off as a shrewish spoilsport, but this is seldom the case. Anderson learned to make Scully her own, finding deep currents of warmth and humor beneath her scientific surface. A 2022 survey of American women with careers in STEM fields found that an extraordinary 63 percent of those of them who grew up during the heyday of <em>The X-Files</em> saw Dana Scully as a role model.</p>
<p>By a few seasons in, it would be obvious that these two characters who rarely touched one another and never called one another by their first names nevertheless loved one another in a far more believable way than the vast majority of couples who were doing the horizontal tango with regularity on television screens. They made a great team on and off the job. As the academic critic Erin Siodmak has written, &#8220;Scully kept it together while Mulder was overemotional, his judgment clouded by his obsessive search for the truth. She eye-rolled his quirks and most absurd theories, and she mocked his masculinity and bravado. Mulder respected Scully&#8217;s intellect, valued her work as a scientist, and offered the safety to be vulnerable without judgment.&#8221; I can&#8217;t emphasize enough how important this relationship was to <em>The X-Files</em>; it was the grace note the show needed to transcend its ripped-from-the-tabloids formula. I like to think it might have proved enlightening to some of the many young male fans of the show, by demonstrating how vibrant and exciting a relationship of equals between a smart man and a smart woman can actually be, whether they&#8217;re having sex or not. Be that as it may, Mulder and Scully are widely and deservedly numbered today among the most iconic onscreen couples in television history.</p>
<p>Needless to say, though, Fox had no idea what the series and its stars would become in these, their formative stages. The network&#8217;s big bet for the fall 1993 season was <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0105932"><em>The Adventures of Brisco County, Jr.</em></a>, a big-budget, high-concept, tongue-in-cheek steampunk Western crafted in the spirit of Steven Spielberg and George Lucas. <em>The X-Files</em>, by contrast, was envisioned as little more than a quickie spinoff from <em>Sightings</em> and its ilk. The budget Chris Carter was given to film his pilot reflected this.</p>
<p>&#8220;We came to Canada for the forests,&#8221; Carter would later say. In reality, that was only the smaller part of its appeal; the bigger draw was the money that could be saved. The pilot&#8217;s script involved, inevitably, an alien abduction, which it described as taking place in a forest in Oregon. Unable to find a spot that fit the bill in Southern California, and unable to afford a location shoot in Oregon, Carter hit upon Vancouver as the solution to his problem. The unbalanced exchange rate between the American and Canadian dollar would work hugely to the show&#8217;s advantage, even as the city government of Vancouver was offering a lot of other perks and incentives in a bid to attract productions just like this one. In this case, they worked better than those who initiated them could ever have dreamed; having come to Vancouver to shoot a pilot on the cheap, <em>The X-Files</em> would remain there for five seasons, 117 episodes, and one feature film. By the end of those five years, it would be difficult to find a place in the city where <em>The X-Files hadn&#8217;t</em> filmed at one time or another. &#8220;Around every corner I come upon an image from the show,&#8221; mused Chris Carter during a return visit in 2018. &#8220;Alleys we shot from every angle. Remarkably, from one high vantage, I can scan at least twenty locations where I directed David and Gillian in episodes and a movie.&#8221; To this day, the show&#8217;s hardcore fans continue to descend upon Vancouver to scope out the street where this chase scene took place or the building where that monster prowled.</p>
<p>The city became far more than just a way for the show to save money. The <em>look</em> of Vancouver &#8212; outside of its short but glorious summer, that is &#8212; became the look of <em>The X-Files</em>. &#8220;From September to late spring,&#8221; says Carter, &#8220;you can count on gray days in low light.&#8221; Even though the episodes were ostensibly set across the width and breadth of North America, as carefully explicated by a caption at the beginning of each one, they too were always marked by gray days and dark nights. An inordinate amount of rain followed Mulder and Scully around, regardless of where they went, enough so as to make you wonder if they were reincarnations of the &#8220;Rain God&#8221; Rob McKenna from <a href="/tag/douglas-adams/?order=asc">Douglas Adams&#8217;s</a> <em>So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish</em>. The murky visuals served to emphasize the show&#8217;s murky truths and moralities. (Ironically, the one type of landscape that was hardest for the show to simulate from wet and rainy British Columbia was the parched desert of the American Southwest, home to both Roswell and the second favorite site of UFO conspiracy buffs, the top-secret Air Force base known as Area 51, where the military supposedly test drives the technology recovered from extraterrestrials at Roswell and possibly elsewhere. In thus forcing the show to shy away somewhat from some of the most overtly obvious plot lines and locations suggested by its premise, this may have been no bad thing.)</p>
<p><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0170817">The pilot episode</a> which Chris Carter delivered to Fox in the spring of 1993 was compromised, as pilots usually are, by the need to do too much at once. It needed both to set up the conditions and characters of the weekly series that would hopefully follow and to demonstrate how a more typical episode would play out from week to week. On the whole, though, it did a serviceable job under the circumstances of bringing Mulder and Scully together at the FBI and sending them out on their very first case of hundreds to come. It even introduced the otherwise anonymous figure who became known as &#8220;Cancer Man&#8221; or the &#8220;Cigarette-Smoking Man&#8221; to fans, thanks to the bad habit in which he is constantly engaged; he would become the show&#8217;s most longstanding recurring villain, shadow-boxing against the protagonists&#8217; efforts to uncover the truth about the American government&#8217;s contact with aliens and much else besides throughout its lengthy run. The pilot ended on what would become a very typical <em>X-Files</em> note, when all of the evidence Mulder and Scully had collected about the alien abduction at its heart literally went up in smoke, the victim of a mysterious fire back at their hotel. In time, this sort of thing would become intensely frustrating, a transparent dodge on the part of the writing staff to keep the wheels of the conspiracy plot lines spinning without ever actually moving them forward. This early on, though, it felt bracing in a television ecosystem where neatly wrapped-up happy endings were still the norm.</p>

I suspect that its existence here was largely at the behest of Fox &#8212; the network, that is, not the FBI agent.</p></div>
<p>Fox pronounced itself satisfied with the pilot. It agreed to fund a full season, albeit at a cut-rate budget of less than $1 million per episode.</p>
<p>So, the pilot was broadcast with little fanfare on September 10, 1993, followed by 23 more episodes over the next months. In a testament to Fox&#8217;s relatively low expectations, the show was relegated to Friday nights. Friday was, along with Saturday, one of the two most undesirable evenings of the week, a traditional dumping ground of shows whose potential was considered limited, since so many of the young adults who were most coveted by advertisers tended to be anywhere other than at home sitting in front of their televisions on those evenings. (This rule of television programming had held true for decades; students of <em>Star Trek</em> history will remember that it was NBC&#8217;s decision in 1968 to move that show to Friday nights that sealed its fate after just three seasons.)</p>
<p><em>The X-Files</em> attracted only scattered, usually lukewarm reviews during its first year on the air. It was often described as a sort of low-rent copy of <em>Twin Peaks</em>, which was perhaps a partial truth but by no means a complete one. (To add grist to this mill, David Duchovny had actually had a small role in <em>Twin Peaks</em>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1A9PT3brNrU&amp;pp=ygUZZGF2aWQgZHVjaG92bnkgdHdpbiBwZWFrcw%3D%3D">playing against his looks</a> in a different way as a transgender law-enforcement agent.) The show put up mediocre ratings against weak competition in its inauspicious time slot.</p>
<p>In truth, it&#8217;s hard to argue that the critics were overlooking any deathless art in that first, comparatively little-watched season of <em>The X-Files</em>. Looking back on those early episodes from the perspective of today, I see a show that&#8217;s just good enough to make me wish it was a little bit better. Our current streaming era has, whatever its own infelicities, served to underline the weaknesses of the old broadcast-network formula all too plainly. Every <em>X-Files</em> episode has to wrap up in exactly 45 minutes, meaning that its scripts occasionally feel bloated and meandering, more often compressed, deprived of the space they need to breathe. Meanwhile the sheer quantity of episodes that the network demanded in a season meant that new ones had to be churned out at a tempo of one every eight to ten days. An uneven standard of quality is a virtual guarantee under such conditions. &#8220;When I was doing 24-episode [seasons],&#8221; says <em>X-Files</em> scriptwriter Glen Morgan, &#8220;we knew that three were going to suck, just because you couldn&#8217;t focus that much. People get annoyed with me for saying this, but, in all honesty, four [episodes] were great, most were okay, and some of them sucked. And that&#8217;s just how it goes!&#8221;</p>
<p>The first season was the phase when <em>The X-Files</em> was taking its core premise most literally. There&#8217;s little of the daring willingness to break its own rules that would come to mark the show in later years. In keeping with Chris Carter&#8217;s original mission statement, the show mostly just wanted to <em>scare</em> you in the beginning. And yet I must confess that I find its parade of aliens, monsters, and preternatural serial killers rather less terrifying than they want to be. It may be telling that my favorite episode of the season, the one called simply <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0751141">&#8220;Ice,&#8221;</a> is largely a rewrite of John W. Campbell&#8217;s wonderfully creepy 1938 novella &#8220;Who Goes There?&#8221;</p>
<div id="attachment_6094" style="width: 610px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://www.filfre.net/2024/09/the-truth-is-out-there-part-2-the-power-of-belief/s1e8/" rel="attachment wp-att-6094"><img decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-6094" class="wp-image-6094" src="https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/s1e8-300x169.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="338" srcset="https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/s1e8-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/s1e8-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/s1e8.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-6094" class="wp-caption-text">A stalemate in an Arctic research station in &#8220;Ice.&#8221; This early psychological thriller of an episode was unique for the way it turned Mulder and Scully against one another, something that would become almost unimaginable a little later in the show&#8217;s run.</p></div>
<p>To my mind, the first season stands out more for its visual aesthetics than for its writing. With so little money in the budget for shiny visual effects, the creators counted on the viewer&#8217;s imagination to fill in blanks that were hidden beneath an awful lot of rain and fog and smoke and darkness. The show used jittery photography to fine effect, a living embodiment of the nervous mood of the scripts; tight closeups in claustrophobic spaces were the norm. <em>The X-Files</em> may have been only dubiously good in the broad strokes at this stage, but it certainly had its own personality right from the start.</p>
<p>The show was saved from going down in history as a one-season wonder like its inspiration <em>Kolchak: The Night Stalker</em> by a happy coincidence involving a different, newer form of media than television. The very same month that the pilot episode was broadcast, Marc Andreessen of the National Center for Supercomputing Applications in Urbana, Illinois, <a href="/2022/05/a-web-around-the-world-part-10-a-web-of-associations">released the first version of his NCSA Mosaic Web browser</a> for personal computers running MacOS and Microsoft Windows. Mosaic was the most effortlessly usable browser to appear to that point, with a killer feature that would transform the look and feel of the nascent World Wide Web forever: it could display pictures on the screen alongside text. The arrival of Mosaic marked the moment when the Web went from being an esoteric tool for scientists and hackers to a revolutionary communications medium for everyone. In its wake, new websites sprang up in unprecedented numbers, as the first rumblings of what would become the dot-com explosion of the later 1990s began to make themselves heard. An inordinate number of these sites dealt with <em>The X-Files</em>, which was perfectly pitched to appeal to the legions of brainy, plugged-in, usually male university students who were Mosaic&#8217;s most prominent early adopters. There was a time when it seemed that every tenth site on the Web was an <em>X-Files</em> site.</p>
<p><em>The X-Files</em> became the first example of a new phenomenon in traditional media, the first television show whose popularity was almost entirely a credit to the new medium of the Internet. On their personal websites and in the freewheeling discussion forums of Usenet, the self-proclaimed &#8220;X-Philes&#8221; declared their love, stated their opinions, and argued endlessly over matters large and small. The monster-of-the-week episodes were all well and good, but it was the mythology episodes that really got them revved up. These were dissected on an almost frame-by-frame level of detail &#8212; far more detail, if we&#8217;re being honest, than they deserved, given the extent to which the writing staff was winging it as they went along. Some of the hardcore fans were disposed to believe in actual government conspiracies, while some were not. But all of them relished the ones seen on the show, wanted to believe as badly as Mulder did that there was a detailed master plan to the mythology locked up in some office at Fox. In truth, of course, no such thing existed then nor ever would.</p>
<p>The obsessive tendencies of the most devoted fans could be almost as disconcerting as they were gratifying to the people who made the show. David Duchovny remembers stumbling into a heated discussion of why the petite Scully is never shown adjusting the car seat after taking over driving duties from the tall and lanky Mulder. &#8220;That was probably the last time I ever looked at the Internet, because that kind of frightened me,&#8221; he says, only half in jest.</p>
<p>Buzz over <em>The X-Files</em> gradually spilled over to other groups whose Venn diagrams overlapped with that of the early Web denizens. One of those with the biggest overlap, and thus another of the groups where the show made its presence known first, happens to be a special interest of this website: computer-game players and developers. Before the show&#8217;s first season had even concluded, the first game to bear the stamp of <em>The X-Files </em>had already appeared on American store shelves.</p>
<p>The Britain-based brothers Julian and Nick Gollop and their tiny studio Mythos Games had started working on a strategy game they called <em>UFO: Enemy Unknown</em>, about a full-blown alien invasion of Earth, a good year and a half before the show made its debut. But by virtue of drawing from many of the same underground ufological sources as <em>The X-Files</em> writing staff, they ended up with similar-looking extraterrestrials and an almost uncannily similar brooding, ominous atmosphere &#8212; this despite the fact that the Gollops had never even seen the show, which wouldn&#8217;t air in their homeland for the first time until six months after their game was released. Nonetheless, the Gollops&#8217; publisher MicroProse played the similarities up for all they were worth in the United States, going so far as to rename the game there to <a href="/2020/09/x-com"><em>X-COM</em></a>; suffice to say that the shared &#8220;X-&#8221; prefix was not a random happenstance.</p>
<p>Hints of <em>The X-Files</em> would continue to show themselves in many games for the rest of the decade, from the <a href="/tag/tex-murphy/?order=asc">Tex Murphy series</a> to <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/game/223/fallout/"><em>Fallout</em></a>. And small wonder: Friday-evening <em>X-Files</em> viewing parties became a bonding ritual at countless games studios, the perfect way to celebrate the conclusion of another working week. The same ritual was enacted by millions of ordinary gamers.</p>
<p>The early fan enthusiasm, combined with a rock-bottom budget and the lack of anything else to put into its Friday-night time slot, were enough to get <em>The X-Files</em> renewed by Fox for a second season that began in September of 1994. (Poor <em>Brisco County</em>, on the other hand, had seen its ratings collapse after a strong start and was cancelled after its first season.) Yet the moment when it became clear that <em>The X-Files</em> was really breaking through didn&#8217;t arrive until that December, when the show was unexpectedly nominated for a Golden Globe Award in the category of Best Television Drama. And then, even more incredibly, it won the award the following month, beating out such prestigious critics&#8217; darlings as <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0108757"><em>ER</em></a> and <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0106079"><em>NYPD Blue</em></a>. To this day, nobody can quite explain how this happened. At the time, nobody was more shocked than the people who made <em>The X-Files</em>. &#8220;When we won, you could hear a pin drop,&#8221; says the show&#8217;s co-producer Paul Rabwin of the reaction in the auditorium. &#8220;It was like the longest shot in the world coming in, and everyone was dumbfounded.&#8221;</p>
<p>Suddenly <em>The X-Files</em> had a serious buzz about it. By the end of season two, it was regularly winning its time slot. While the numbers it put up still weren&#8217;t huge in the abstract, they were an advertiser&#8217;s wet dream in terms of demographics. The prototypical<em> X-Files</em> viewer was described as &#8220;male, 25 to 34 years old, college educated, residing in the northeastern United States, a moderate television viewer but also a <em>Star Trek</em> fan, and an Internet user.&#8221; Millions of people who resembled at least some parts of this description were willing to plan their Friday evenings around catching the latest episode of the show. The pump had been well and truly primed for the alien-autopsy special that aired on Fox that August.</p>
<p>Whatever was fueling the show&#8217;s growing popularity, it certainly wasn&#8217;t a case of full-scale reinvention. Going into the second season, Chris Carter had made it clear that his core vision was unchanged. &#8220;Ultimately,&#8221; he said, &#8220;my goal [is] the same that it&#8217;s always been: to create 22 to 24 really scary shows. I just want to scare the hell out of the audience. That&#8217;s all.&#8221;</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, then, the second season of <em>The X-Files</em> isn&#8217;t hugely different from the first in style and spirit. The Cancer Man is still smoking in the shadows in the mythology episodes, and serial killers are still the monsters of the week as often as not. That said, there are some signs that the show is changing. The episode <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0751102">&#8220;Die Hand Die Verletzt&#8221;</a> is a slightly tongue-in-cheek story of a cabal of Satanists who double as a local school board. It draws more from the farcical, partially <a href="/2011/07/dungeons-and-dragons"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em></a>-fueled <a href="/2012/07/britains-occult-uncle">Satanic panics</a> of the 1980s than it does from more respectable Satanic horrors like <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0063522"><em>Rosemary&#8217;s Baby</em></a> and <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0070047"><em>The Exorcist</em></a>. Fox had once been all over that stuff, much as it was all over the UFO stuff now. More and more as time went on, <em>The</em><em> X-Files</em> would be sending up the tackier tendencies of its parent network.</p>

<p>But the episode that really threw open a window to let some fresh air into the show&#8217;s hermetically sealed world appeared two months later. The script for <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0751139">&#8220;Humbug&#8221;</a> was the first to be credited solely to Darin Morgan, who would go on to become one of <em>The X-Files&#8217;</em>s standout writers. Its setting, <a href="/2014/12/ballyhoo">an encampment of carnival sideshow performers</a>, was plainly inspired by the unnerving 1932 B-movie <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0022913"><em>Freaks</em></a>. In this context, however, it was used in the service of something perilously close to full-on comedy. This was a first for the show, one which had prompted much debate and soul-searching among the production staff and at the network before the episode was green-lit. The circus performers spend most of their time taking the piss out of Mulder, this mental Hephaestus in the body of an Adonis. And when the script isn&#8217;t making fun of him through them, it&#8217;s making fun of some of the core premises of the show itself. By no means were all of the fans pleased by this development; it seemed to some of them a slippery slope from mocking the show that they adored to mocking <em>them</em>. Even the fact that the episode aired the night before April Fool&#8217;s Day, thus indicating that a comedy installment might become no more than an annual indulgence at worst, wasn&#8217;t enough to mollify all of the viewers who liked their <em>X-Files</em> dark and po-faced.</p>

Just because it&#8217;s human nature to make assumptions about people purely on the basis of their physical appearances? Why, I&#8217;ve done the same thing to you, for example. I&#8217;ve taken in your all-American features, your dour demeanor, your unimaginative necktie design, and concluded that you work for the government&#8230; an FBI agent. But you see the tragedy? I have unconsciously reduced you to a stereotype, instead of regarding you as a specific, unique individual.&#8221;<br /> <br />&#8220;But I am an FBI agent&#8230;&#8221;</p></div>
<p>For my part, though, I say it was about time. After all, <em>The X-Files</em> is a pretty ridiculous show on the face of it, riven from top to bottom with cognitive dissonance. Mulder and Scully are simultaneously the two busiest and the two most incompetent agents in the history of the FBI, who have apparently never heard that most important piece of advice for anyone trapped in a horror movie or in a law-enforcement training course: <em>Don&#8217;t split up!</em> They&#8217;re constantly rushing alone into danger without bothering to tell each other what they&#8217;re doing, much less telling any of their other colleagues, and constantly getting themselves <em>almost</em> killed, being saved only by the plot armor provided by their place at the top of the credits list.</p>
<p>Unanswerable questions abound. Why does a government whose conspiratorial tendrils reach into every conceivable aspect of life not just kill these two rogue agents in its midst? Why does Scully insist anew at the beginning of every single episode that, no, this latest case surely doesn&#8217;t involve anything supernatural, when by the end of the episode it <em>almost always does?</em> Isn&#8217;t her perverse resistance to extraordinary evidence in some way the opposite of the scientific method?</p>
<p>By slyly cluing us in to the fact that the show&#8217;s own creators were aware of all of this &#8212; that they were actually much smarter than the likes of <em>Sightings</em> &#8212; &#8220;Humbug&#8221; gave us permission not to take the show so seriously. We know it&#8217;s silly and you know it&#8217;s silly, it seemed to say, so feel free to laugh if you want to. Or, if you like, feel free to take the show seriously but still not quite literally. Vintage television is sometimes described as a character- rather than a plot-driven format. We watch mainly in order to hang out with characters that we know and like; what they actually get up to there on the screen is just the excuse for giving them a show. Happily, and despite the novel ambitions of the mythology plot lines, <em>The X-Files</em> had two leads strong enough to make the show work on this level. Mind you, this would not keep some fans from trying to slot every little anecdote into some master canon of an <em>X-Files</em> universe &#8212; and more power to anyone who enjoys that sort of thing. But it was and is a nice message for the less literal-minded among us to hear. As the first episode willing to unabashedly embrace the &#8220;meta,&#8221; &#8220;Humbug&#8221; might just be the most important &#8212; not the best, but the most important &#8212; episode of <em>The X-Files</em> ever made.</p>
<p>By the third season, more <em>X-Files</em> episodes &#8212; especially the ones written by Darin Morgan &#8212; were abandoning the usual formulas to begin mining richer veins of myth and magical realism. <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0751092">&#8220;Clyde Bruckman&#8217;s Final Repose,&#8221;</a> for example, gives us a man who has been cursed to foresee the whens and hows of the deaths that await every single one of us someday. One of the most touching moments in the show&#8217;s history comes when Scully asks him how she will die. &#8220;You don&#8217;t,&#8221; replies veteran character actor Peter Boyle in a voice touched with mercy, with an expression on his face that tells us all too clearly that he&#8217;s lying. Such are the lies that we all tell ourselves and one another in order to get through this thing called life.</p>

<p>And then there&#8217;s <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0751147">&#8220;Jose Chung&#8217;s <em>From Outer Space</em>,&#8221;</a> a suitably odd name for an incredibly odd episode. Here <em>The X-Files</em> goes full-on postmodern avant-garde for the first time, wrapping truth and fiction and the liminal spaces in between into a hopeless tangle that&#8217;s shot through with allusions to everything from <em>Star Wars</em> to <em>Close Encounters</em> to <em>Twin Peaks</em>. Jose Chung himself is a riff on Truman Capote, writing a version of <em>In Cold Blood</em> involving aliens. His presence, along with a cameo by Alex Trebek, the host of the television game show <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0159881"><em>Jeopardy!</em></a>, is an elaborate callback to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxxITh9RPpo">David Duchovny&#8217;s turn on <em>Celebrity Jeopardy!</em></a>, which he lost to author Stephen King in the final round when he couldn&#8217;t remember the name of Capote&#8217;s novel <em>Breakfast at Tiffany&#8217;s</em>. And so it goes, and so it goes, around and around in a fashion guaranteed to delight any post-doc in postmodern literary theory.<span class="footnote_referrer"><a role="button" tabindex="0" onclick="footnote_moveToReference_6073_16('footnote_plugin_reference_6073_16_1');" onkeypress="footnote_moveToReference_6073_16('footnote_plugin_reference_6073_16_1');" ><sup id="footnote_plugin_tooltip_6073_16_1" class="footnote_plugin_tooltip_text">[1]</sup></a><span id="footnote_plugin_tooltip_text_6073_16_1" class="footnote_tooltip">The first full-length academic book deconstructing <em>The X-Files</em> appeared already in 1996, while the third season was still airing.

<p>In this episode, <em>The X-Files</em> comments for a second time in the course of a single season on the real-world alien-autopsy sensation for which it itself had laid the groundwork. The moment when Scully conducts her own autopsy on an alien, only to snag her scalpel on a zipper &#8212; it turns out that it&#8217;s just a dead guy in an alien suit &#8212; is as hilarious as it is subversive. Ditto the way the show, just one year removed from its first tentative steps in this direction in &#8220;Humbug,&#8221; now dares to directly and unabashedly mock a portion of its most hardcore audience, personified as a young man living in his parents&#8217; basement who wants desperately to be carried away by aliens so that his dad will stop hounding him to get a job. &#8220;Roswell! Roswell!&#8221; he shouts apropos of nothing when all other words and logic have failed him.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are those who care not about extraterrestrials, searching for meaning in other human beings,&#8221; Jose Chung tells us at the end. &#8220;Rare or lucky are those who find it.&#8221; It&#8217;s strongly implied that they are the most enlightened ones, regardless of their ultimate success rate &#8212; a strange message for a show invented to exploit interest in UFOs to convey, but by no means an unwise or unwelcome one.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the fourth season, Fox finally saw fit to move <em>The X-Files</em> out of the Friday graveyard slot and over to Sunday evenings. The <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0751153/?ref_=ttep_ep12">twelfth episode</a> of that season aired just after the Super Bowl on January 26, 1997, becoming thereby the most-watched single installment of the show ever, seen by almost 30 million American households. From its humble roots, <em>The X-Files</em> had grown up to become a show that absolutely everybody at least knew <em>of</em>. &#8220;You cannot get an issue of <em>TV Guide</em> or <em>Entertainment Weekly</em> or <em>People</em> without someone referring to the show,&#8221; marveled Paul Rabwin. &#8220;There have been political cartoons, references in the funnies, and newspaper headlines. It&#8217;s no longer something that needs explanation.&#8221;</p>
<p>Yet the show definitely wasn&#8217;t dumbing itself down to please the masses. <a href="/2022/07/broken-sword-the-shadow-of-the-templars"><em>Foucault&#8217;s Pendulum</em></a> has nothing on the conspiracy theorist&#8217;s magic brownie that is the fourth season&#8217;s <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0751164">&#8220;Musings of a Cigarette-Smoking Man,&#8221;</a> in which we learn that Cancer Man not only personally carried out the assassinations of John F. Kennedy and Martin Luther King but has been fixing the Grammy Awards and the Super Bowl all these years as well. (He has a special dislike for the Buffalo Bills.) We even see him watching the pilot of <em>The X-Files</em> approvingly, implying that the whole show we&#8217;ve been viewing is yet another piece of government misinformation. The mind boggles&#8230;</p>

<p>It&#8217;s clever, yes, but is it anything more than that? There&#8217;s only so far you can take this sort of thing before it becomes masturbatory &#8212; empty tricksterism for its own sake, without much to say to us beyond well-worn grad-school clichés about the &#8220;instability of truth&#8221; and the &#8220;illusion of the objective&#8221; and all the rest of that tired lot.</p>
<p>Enter one Vince Gilligan, who had started writing for <em>The X-Files</em> already in the second season but didn&#8217;t really begin to come into his own until the fourth, when he claimed the title of the show&#8217;s most consistently interesting scriptwriter from Darin Morgan. As if to highlight this passing of the guard, the latter stepped in front of the camera to star in Gilligan&#8217;s <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0751205">&#8220;Small Potatoes,&#8221;</a> playing a schlubby loser named Eddie who has the power to take on the appearance of any man he wishes to be. Predictably enough, he uses this power to seduce women left and right. Inevitably, he winds up becoming Mulder, and is closing in for the kiss with Scully which we&#8217;ve been waiting the better part of four seasons to see when the real Mulder bursts in on the two. Like so many of Gilligan&#8217;s scripts that are still to come, it&#8217;s funny and thought-provoking but also warm and sweet and a little melancholy, operating almost on the level of parable, a million miles removed from the gritty horror which the show was always trying to project in its earliest days. I think I see a kindred soul in Vince Gilligan: someone who is less fascinated by the plot machinery of the show&#8217;s myriad conspiracies than he is by this man who&#8217;s decided to devote his life to chasing chimeras and by this woman who, it&#8217;s pretty clear by now, loves him deeply and is loved by him in return. &#8220;I was born a loser, but you&#8217;re one by choice,&#8221; says the once-more schlubby Eddie to Mulder at the end. &#8220;You should get out and live more.&#8221;</p>
<div id="attachment_6099" style="width: 610px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://www.filfre.net/2024/09/the-truth-is-out-there-part-2-the-power-of-belief/s4e20/" rel="attachment wp-att-6099"><img decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-6099" class="wp-image-6099" src="https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/s4e20-300x169.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="338" srcset="https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/s4e20-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/s4e20-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/s4e20.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-6099" class="wp-caption-text">Pre-coitus interruptus.</p></div>
<p>More extreme incarnations of people like me and perhaps Gilligan were becoming prominent in <em>X-Files</em> fandom by now. They were called the &#8220;shippers,&#8221; as in &#8220;relationshippers.&#8221; The most obsessive analyzed every stray glance that Mulder and Scully cast at one another every bit as exhaustively as another type of fan pored over fleeting shots of aliens and every randomly dropped aside by Cancer Man. Some shippers preferred to keep to the terrain of speculation, while others wrote exactly how it would go down once Scully finally agreed to give Mulder&#8217;s sadly underused but doubtless impressive manly member a good solid shakedown trial. The majority of the shippers were women, who were flocking to the show in increasing numbers now.</p>
<p>Indeed, by the end of the fourth season, <em>The X-Files</em> was at its zenith of popularity and cultural influence. It was the biggest show on Fox by a wide margin and the fourth most popular drama on all of network television. (Within that category, it trailed only <em>ER</em>, <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0108968"><em>Touched by an Angel</em></a>, and <em>NYPD Blue</em>.) Its tag lines &#8212; &#8220;The Truth Is Out There&#8221;; &#8220;I Want To Believe&#8221; &#8212; were being repeated everywhere, sometimes in earnest and sometimes in jest, much as on the show itself. Chris Carter&#8217;s <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0115270"><em>Millennium</em></a>, a semi-spinoff from <em>The X-Files </em>about an FBI agent who could read the minds of criminals, had just finished its own first season to positive reviews and solid ratings. Never a man lacking in ambition, Carter was making plans to conquer a whole new realm by shooting an <em>X-Files</em> feature film between the fifth and sixth seasons.</p>
<p>And oh, yes&#8230; there was to be an <em>X-Files</em> game as well &#8212; a game, that is, that wasn&#8217;t just influenced by the show but actually sported its name on the box.</p>

<blockquote><p>The idea that there are visitors to the planet, that they are not only visiting now but have been visiting since prehistory, and how it affects us is a very interesting idea. I suppose, just looking up into the night sky at all those millions of stars up there, you wonder if it&#8217;s possible. I have a pet theory that everyone wants to have that experience where they&#8217;re driving down a desert road at night, and they see something and can&#8217;t explain what it is. I think it&#8217;s all about religion. Not necessarily Christian religion, but it&#8217;s about beliefs &#8212; and meaning and truth and why are we here and why are they here and who&#8217;s lying to us. Encountering a UFO would be like witnessing a miracle.</p>

<p>In July of 1993 &#8212; or maybe it was 1992 &#8212; a British music archivist named Ray Santilli traveled to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM-IEMlJyak">Cleveland, Ohio,</a> a city which had been a hotbed of early rock and roll three and a half decades previously, hosting concerts by everyone from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihvhQAZPo6Q">Bill Haley</a> to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bLaPnpjw-pc">Elvis Presley</a>. Now, Santilli was hoping to unearth some buried treasures of that era for the sake of posterity and profit: audio recordings, pictures, or, best of all if possible, video footage of one of the most important cultural movements of the twentieth century in its nascent stage.</p>
<p>Santilli put an announcement in a local newspaper, explaining who he was and what he had come for, dangling the prospect of generous compensation for any artifacts that fit the bill. Amidst a lot of dross and false leads, he received a call from a fellow whose 82-year-old father, so the caller claimed, had just what the energetic Briton dreamed of finding here in the American heartland. The elderly man in question, whom Santilli would later identify only as &#8220;Jack B.,&#8221; had worked a big open-air concert in Cleveland in 1957 as a cameraman. While some of the footage he had shot there was already a part of the public record, he had some additional reels of heretofore unseen film stashed in his attic in Florida, the state to which he had retired some years ago.</p>
<p>Santilli secured an invitation to visit Jack in Florida the next time he came to the United States; luckily, this was to happen in just a few months. When he arrived at the former cameraman&#8217;s snug little home, he was gratified to learn that his host was a straight shooter. Just as promised, Jack produced footage of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDMAP2kRC4c">a lean and hungry Elvis Presley</a> giving the staid America of the Eisenhower era a good solid rocking and rolling. The transaction was quickly concluded: Santilli handed Jack a wad of cash, and Jack handed over the film, which Santilli would go on to include in <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0984979">a videotape compilation</a> of early Elvis and Johnny Cash concert performances.</p>
<p>He was packing his suitcase in his hotel room the next morning, feeling quite pleased with himself at having gotten what he had come for, when Jack unexpectedly rang him up again. &#8220;Ray, are you interested in other material as well?&#8221; asked the old man at the other end of the line. Santilli said cautiously that he might be, depending on what it was. &#8220;Then come over here again,&#8221; said Jack. &#8220;I have something here that may be even more interesting than the Elvis film.&#8221;</p>
<p>Intrigued despite himself, Santilli swung by the house on his way to the airport. Jack sat him down on the couch and pointed to a raggedy cardboard box that sat on the living-room floor. It was full of 16-millimeter film canisters. &#8220;Ray, have you ever heard of the Roswell incident?&#8221; asked Jack. Santilli shook his head. &#8220;Well,&#8221; said Jack, &#8220;a UFO crashed in the desert near Roswell, New Mexico, in 1947. I filmed the salvaging.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jack went on to explain that he had been drafted into the United States Army during the Second World War, but that a childhood bout with polio had rendered him unfit for combat duty in the eyes of the military. Instead he had worked as a cameraman for the Army during and after the war; he hadn&#8217;t left the service until 1952. During his near-decade in uniform, he had filmed various top-secret projects and tests, including <a href="/2015/02/t-plus-0-the-fulcrum-of-history">the very first explosion of an atomic bomb</a> in another part of the New Mexico desert. But nothing compared to the day in 1947 when he was sent to Roswell to document everything that was going on there. He filmed extensively at the crash site of the UFO. And then he was flown to a military base near Dallas, Texas, to film the autopsies of two alien corpses that had been recovered from the wreckage. This was the footage that he had been storing in his attic all this time. According to him, the Army had simply forgotten to send anyone around to pick it up. Now, at long last, he had decided to sell it, in order to pay for a big wedding for his favorite granddaughter. He wanted $150,000 in cash &#8212; &#8220;owing to the taxes, you know. You get the film. I get the money. And you tell nobody where you got the film from.&#8221;</p>
<p>Santilli told Jack that he wasn&#8217;t the sort of person to buy anything sight unseen. Acceding to the wisdom of this policy, Jack set up the same projector on which they had watched Elvis&#8217;s gyrations the day before, pulled the curtains down over the windows, and started the machine clack-clacking into motion. On a clear patch of wall in front of him, Santilli saw the flickering images that would transfix the world a couple of years later. A humanoid but plainly inhuman corpse lay on a bare metal table. It had a bulbous head and eyes and a shrunken, childlike body with a distended belly that caused him to wonder if it was pregnant. It had two arms and two legs, but six fingers on each hand and six toes on each foot. It appeared to be completely hairless, its skin vaguely fish-like in pallor and texture. Two presumably human doctors, their faces hidden beneath the hooded contamination suits they wore, examined and then cut the body open while a third man in a face mask looked on from behind a pane of safety glass.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.filfre.net/2024/09/the-truth-is-out-there-part-1-the-will-to-believe/alien1/" rel="attachment wp-att-6078"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-6078" src="https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/alien1-300x230.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="230" srcset="https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/alien1-300x230.jpg 300w, https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/alien1-768x590.jpg 768w, https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/alien1.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p>Passionate about music though he was, Santilli recognized immediately that this was more important &#8212; and vastly more valuable &#8212; than all of the lost rock-and-roll footage in the world combined. If, that is, it really was what Jack claimed it to be.</p>
<p>The reels were stamped with the Kodak name. So, Santilli placed a call right then and there to that company&#8217;s headquarters in Rochester, New York, and asked to be forwarded to the records department. &#8220;I have some old 16-millimeter film which is supposed to date back to 1947,&#8221; he said to the man who came on the line. &#8220;How can I tell whether this is true?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We have a simple system for that,&#8221; answered the man from Kodak. &#8220;There should be a geometric code on the edge of the film. What symbols do you see there?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A square and a triangle,&#8221; said Santilli.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good. Just a moment&#8230; yes, that was 1947.&#8221;</p>
<p>Santilli was satisfied. Unfortunately, though, he wasn&#8217;t a wealthy man; he certainly didn&#8217;t have $150,000 in his pocket to hand to give to Jack there and then. Telling the old man that he would get in touch again just as soon as he could, he flew home to London to start beating the bushes for the funds.</p>
<p>It proved harder to raise the money than he had ever anticipated. Even leaving aside how absurd this claim of an alien-autopsy film sounded on the face of it, few would have been eager under any circumstances to pony up $150,000 for a source whose real identity they didn&#8217;t even know, for a piece of merchandise that only Santilli himself had seen. Convinced that he was on the cusp of a coup that would make the revelations of Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein seem like small potatoes, Santilli called every number in his Rolodex in a near panic. For he knew that Jack&#8217;s health was not particularly good, and he lived in fear that the old man would die on him before he could come up with the money. Nonetheless, it wasn&#8217;t until November of 1994 that he was able to convince a German music producer named Volker Spielberg to finance the purchase. That same month, Santilli made the round trip to Florida again, returning this time with the 22 reels of film in his luggage.</p>

<p>Being nearly 50 years old and having been stored in less than ideal conditions throughout that time, many of the reels were in extremely bad shape. Santilli therefore sent them first to a conservator, to be restored as much as possible and then copied onto other media for long-term preservation. Once that had been done, it was finally time to announce the film&#8217;s existence to the world.</p>
<p>On March 11, 1995, Santilli invited to a London movie theater a bizarre cross-section of public figures: serious journalists along with not-so-serious entertainers; prominent UFO believers along with skeptics; noted scientists along with representatives of most of the world&#8217;s major religious faiths; even the former head of the British Ministry of Defence&#8217;s controversial, recently concluded &#8220;UFO Project.&#8221; That project had declared in its final summary that it could find no evidence that extraterrestrials had ever visited our planet, much less that any terrestrial government had conspired to cover up such an event. Perhaps its director would now feel compelled to revisit the matter.</p>
<p>Or maybe not. &#8220;The result [of the first screening] was absolute, total rejection,&#8221; lamented Santilli later on. &#8220;They all considered it a swindle. Some even left in the middle of the show.&#8221;</p>
<p>Undaunted, Santilli kept right on knocking on doors. Most of the news organizations he contacted wanted to do a full forensic examination of the film before they would agree to license it; this Santilli did not wish to allow. Rupert Murdoch, however, was not so scrupulous.</p>
<p>Already at that time, Murdoch was the worldwide king of tabloid journalism and much else in mass media besides. He was by then well along in the process of building a staggering fortune out of the understanding that many or most consumers of &#8220;news&#8221; don&#8217;t want objective facts; they want news that will <em>entertain</em> them, at the same time that it confirms the worldviews to which they are most predisposed. His fortune would only continue to grow over the decades to come, as he continued to put this understanding into ruthless practice.</p>
<p>Murdoch came out of a private screening of the alien-autopsy film knowing that he simply had to have it. He prepared a contract which made Santilli and his largely silent partner Volker Spielberg rich men overnight. Then he made plans to show the film to maximum advantage all over the world &#8212; including in the biggest media market of them all, the country of its alleged origin. He passed the film to Robert Kiviat, the coordinating producer of an American &#8220;documentary&#8221; series called <em>Encounters</em>. Airing on Murdoch&#8217;s young and scrappy Fox television network, <em>Encounters</em> dealt in alien abductions, crop circles, ghosts, Bigfoot, and similar paranormal and/or conspiratorial fodder.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, August 28, 1995, Fox broadcast a program called <em>Alien Autopsy: Fact or Fiction?</em>, whose one-hour running time &#8212; or rather 45 minutes with commercials &#8212; included about four of the nineteen and a half minutes of footage which Santilli had provided to Murdoch. The balance of the time was spent talking <em>about</em> the film, plus the long-rumored UFO crash at Roswell whose veracity it might prove.</p>
<p>The host of the program was Jonathan Frakes, the actor who had played Commander Will Riker of the starship <em>Enterprise</em> on the recently concluded television series <em>Star Trek: The Next Generation</em>, and was thereby presumed to have some special insight into aliens from outer space. Although the title of the show seemed to describe it as an inquiry into the authenticity of the film, the affirmative case was given a lot more air time than the negative. &#8220;It was not what you would expect from a major network that thought it was broadcasting a history-making film,&#8221; noted the magazine <em>Skeptical Inquirer</em> later on. &#8220;It was, however, what you would expect from a network trying very hard not to spoil an illusion.&#8221; The show&#8217;s field director, John Jopson, claims today that he was told in no uncertain terms to can it when he persisted in asking too many questions of Ray Santilli. &#8220;Cut the <a href="/2014/06/perry-mason-the-case-of-the-mandarin-murder">Perry Mason</a> act and finish the show,&#8221; is what he says that Robert Kiviat told him. &#8220;It was made clear to me that, if the footage was exposed as a hoax, the ratings would suffer,&#8221; he elaborates. (Kiviat denies that these exchanges ever took place.)</p>
<p>In place of a hard-hitting interrogation of Santilli, an expert from Kodak testified that the film stock  appeared to stem from 1927, 1947, or 1967 (it turned out that the geometric codes were periodically reused); a former military cameraman who had worked during the same era as Jack B. testified that the film was consistent with the equipment and shooting techniques he had employed; the prominent pathologist Cyril Wecht testified that the men seen performing the autopsy in the film were, judging from the procedures they followed, &#8220;either [themselves] pathologists or surgeons who have done a fair number of autopsies&#8221;; the Hollywood special-effects guru Stan Winston testified that &#8220;my hats are off to the people who created it &#8212; <em>or</em> [to] the poor alien who is dead on the table.&#8221;</p>

<p>The program proved every bit the cultural bombshell and ratings bonanza Rupert Murdoch had thought it could be. It became the most-watched show in its time slot that evening, a major achievement for Fox, which normally still lagged well behind CBS, NBC, and ABC, the older &#8220;Big Three&#8221; American networks. From one day to the next, the water-cooler discourse in the country switched from such comparatively prosaic matters as the Oklahoma City bombing and the O.J. Simpson murder trial to aliens and UFOs and Roswell, Roswell, Roswell. The demand from those who had missed the program&#8217;s first airing was so enormous that Fox showed it again a week later, with three precious additional minutes of footage from the film appended onto the end. Even more households tuned in to watch this encore.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Murdoch was using his far-flung media empire to bring the same show to other markets, with much the same results. The buzz eventually reached all the way to the ears of the most powerful man in the world. On November 30, 1995, during a state visit to Northern Ireland, President Bill Clinton was asked by a twelve-year-old boy what he knew about Roswell and the alien-autopsy film. Cracking an awkward smile, he answered, &#8220;If the United States Air Force did recover alien bodies, they didn&#8217;t tell me about it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Skeptical voices had a hard time cutting through the excitement. Even they had to acknowledge that, if it was a fake, the film wasn&#8217;t an entirely inept or thoughtless one. For example, the clock and the telephone that could be seen on the wall of the examination room, even the metal tray used to hold the doctors&#8217; saws and scalpels, were period correct.</p>
<p>All the same, there were some serious discordances to be espied as well, discordances which only became clearer once it was possible to view all nineteen and a half minutes at once on the inevitable home-video release. &#8220;Ufologists&#8221; wondered why the aliens in the film didn&#8217;t fully agree with the eye-witness accounts of people who had supposedly seen the bodies after the crash at Roswell; their aliens had no ears and four fingers, whereas these ones had small ears and six fingers. Scientists wondered at the strange suits worn by the doctors, which could have protected them from neither radiation nor biological contaminants; the one useful purpose they did seem to serve was to conceal the faces and thus the identities of the doctors themselves. And then, you didn&#8217;t have to be a ufologist or a scientist to wonder why an historic event such as this one would have had only four witnesses including the cameraman, why the autopsy was done as if everyone involved had someplace else he urgently needed to be in an hour or so, and why the cameraman was so gosh-darned bad at his job, allowing his camera to go out of focus and stay that way every time he zoomed in for a closeup.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.filfre.net/2024/09/the-truth-is-out-there-part-1-the-will-to-believe/alien2/" rel="attachment wp-att-6081"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-6081" src="https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/alien2-300x236.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="236" srcset="https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/alien2-300x236.jpg 300w, https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/alien2-768x603.jpg 768w, https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/alien2.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p>For that matter, where was the cameraman anyway? Even if Ray Santilli himself refused to share any further information &#8212; thus honoring, so he said, the promise of anonymity which he had made to the old man &#8212; couldn&#8217;t any competent private investigator track down a man in his mid-eighties who currently lived in Florida, had formerly lived in Ohio, had contracted polio as a child, and had been drafted into the Army during the Second World War and continued to serve until 1952? Many investigators tried, but none could locate him.</p>
<p>To make matters worse, the details of Santilli&#8217;s story kept changing, much to the dismay of those who craved just one set of facts to check. For example, as I alluded to at the beginning of this article, sometimes it was 1992 and sometimes 1993 when he first encountered the film. His story wasn&#8217;t even internally consistent when you really stopped to think about it. Why was Jack B. worried about taxes when he expected to be paid under the table with a proverbial unmarked envelope full of cash?</p>
<p>More information emerged from Kodak, revealing that the film they had examined had consisted only of five frames of blank leader, a tiny snippet of celluloid which could have come from anywhere: &#8220;Sure, it could be an old film, but it doesn&#8217;t mean it is what the aliens were filmed on.&#8221;</p>
<p>Arguably the most devastating criticisms came from a legion of pathologists, who, in marked contrast to their credulous colleagues on the Fox special, saw all sorts of oddities and inconsistencies in the footage.<span class="footnote_referrer"><a role="button" tabindex="0" onclick="footnote_moveToReference_6072_18('footnote_plugin_reference_6072_18_1');" onkeypress="footnote_moveToReference_6072_18('footnote_plugin_reference_6072_18_1');" ><sup id="footnote_plugin_tooltip_6072_18_1" class="footnote_plugin_tooltip_text">[1]</sup></a><span id="footnote_plugin_tooltip_text_6072_18_1" class="footnote_tooltip">It turned out that Cyril Wecht, Fox&#8217;s chosen pathologist, had a penchant for conspiracy theories long before the alien-autopsy special was aired. In 1978, he was one of four pathologists who were allowed to reexamine all of the material gathered during the John F. Kennedy autopsy; he was the only one who insisted that the president&#8217;s wounds were inconsistent with the conclusion of the Warren Commission that there had been only one shooter. He went on to write several books on the subject, and served as a consultant to Oliver Stone&#8217;s 1991 movie <em>JFK</em>, which pushed the theory of an inside job by the CIA.</span></span><script type="text/javascript"> jQuery('#footnote_plugin_tooltip_6072_18_1').tooltip({ tip: '#footnote_plugin_tooltip_text_6072_18_1', tipClass: 'footnote_tooltip', effect: 'fade', predelay: 0, fadeInSpeed: 200, delay: 400, fadeOutSpeed: 200, position: 'bottom center', relative: true, offset: [-7, 100], });</script> They said that the doctors held their instruments awkwardly and seemed to have no method whatsoever to their madness, making random slices and scooping out the aliens&#8217; organs willy-nilly. Speaking of which: the aliens themselves seemed more like grotty Halloween piñatas than formerly living organisms, mere sacks filled with amorphous lumps of viscera. &#8220;I cannot fathom that an alien who had external organs so much like ours could not have some sort of definitive structural organs internally,&#8221; said one pathologist by the name of Ed Uthman. Similarly, special-effects experts &#8212; the ones not contacted by Fox &#8212; said that, while the film was not a terrible fake by any means, these dead aliens were nevertheless well within the scope of their craft to provide to a filmmaker of even modest means. Based on testimony like this, even many ardent ufologists became convinced that the film was a fraud, possibly deliberately planted by a government that was eager to discredit their avocation.</p>
<p>Finally, there was the central absurdity that always dogged all of the talk of Roswell: that these aliens had made their way to Earth over distances of which the human mind can scarcely conceive, avoiding meteors and black holes and all sorts of other cosmic perils that are equally far removed from our capability to even imagine, only to get a stray pigeon or something stuck in their spaceship&#8217;s engine grille and wipe out in some farmer&#8217;s field. It <em>could</em> happen, one had to assume, but boy, did the odds seem stacked against it.</p>
<p>Despite all of these commonsense objections, the public consensus that the film was as likely real as not held for quite some time across much of the Western world. Interestingly, the one outlier here was Germany, a country which had lived through another embarrassing hoax at the beginning of the previous decade, when a rogue journalist from the respected magazine <em>Stern</em> and an underworld document forger had produced a set of purported diaries written by Adolf Hitler that had equally entranced the world. Call it a case of once bitten, twice shy; both <em>Stern</em> and its arch-rival <em>Der Spiegel</em> came out stridently against the film&#8217;s authenticity from the start. Obviously relishing the chance to pour a bit more salt into an old wound, <em>Der Spiegel</em> explicitly called the alien-autopsy film the 1990s equivalent to the Hitler diaries. <em>Stern</em> didn&#8217;t go quite that far, but it did roundly chastise the film&#8217;s peddlers. &#8220;If you want to fool us, you have to try a little harder,&#8221; it wrote with the hard-won wisdom of experience.</p>
<p>The Germans and the other skeptics were right, of course. The origin story I passed on to you at the beginning of this article &#8212; at least everything after Santilli&#8217;s acquisition of his footage of Elvis Presley in concert &#8212; is a complete lie. Facing increasing pressure to explain the many aspects of his story that didn&#8217;t fully make sense, Santilli committed a blatant self-own in 1997, when he showed pictures of the canisters in which, so he claimed, the film had been stored when he acquired it. (He was still refusing to provide the artifacts themselves for forensic examination.) The canisters were neatly labeled, &#8220;Property of the Department of Defense.&#8221; But, sadly for him, no agency of the American government had yet existed under that name at the time the autopsy was supposed to have been conducted.</p>
<p>And so the fever dream broke. Switching tacks without missing a beat, Fox in 1998 included the film in a television special called <em>World&#8217;s Greatest Hoaxes</em>, as if they had had nothing to do with this hoax&#8217;s dissemination. The producer and mastermind of that show was&#8230; Robert Kiviat, the man behind the original alien-autopsy special. You can&#8217;t make this stuff up.</p>
<p>In 2004, long after the cultural moment that had produced the alien-autopsy sensation had passed into history, Ray Santilli finally came clean &#8212; partially, at any rate. He admitted to the British television presenter Eamonn Holmes that he and a few friends had faked the film in a vacant London flat, using &#8220;aliens&#8221; that had been made out of plaster and stuffed with sheep brains, chicken entrails, and other assorted offal picked up at a local butcher shop. (The smell in the apartment, the hoaxers said, was &#8220;horrendous.&#8221;) After the filming was complete, they had cut what was left of the aliens up into small pieces and dropped them into dumpsters all over the city, as you do when you&#8217;re looking to hide the evidence of a crime.</p>
<p>Plainly worried about his legal exposure for perpetrating this fraud that had made him a millionaire, Santilli hedged his bets by insisting that he really <em>had</em> bought an alien-autopsy film from Jack B. in Florida, but that the reels that held it had literally crumbled into dust within a few days of being exposed to the air in London. (Was pollution particularly bad that year?) The film he had sold to Rupert Murdoch had been a &#8220;reconstruction&#8221; of what he had seen on the original reels. &#8220;It&#8217;s no different from restoring a work of art like the <em>Mona Lisa</em>,&#8221; he insisted. This might be true &#8212; if, that is, an art restorer&#8217;s job involved painting from scratch a new version of a work he had once glimpsed briefly, then passing it off as the original. As it is, this process goes by the alternative name of &#8220;forgery&#8221; in most circles. Even Santilli could hardly keep a straight face as he spouted this nonsense to a wide-eyed Eamonn Holmes. His tell is his smirk.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.filfre.net/2024/09/the-truth-is-out-there-part-1-the-will-to-believe/santilli/" rel="attachment wp-att-6075"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-6075" src="https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/santilli-204x300.jpg" alt="" width="204" height="300" srcset="https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/santilli-204x300.jpg 204w, https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/santilli-695x1024.jpg 695w, https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/santilli-768x1132.jpg 768w, https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/santilli.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 204px) 100vw, 204px" /></a></p>
<p>The reason Santilli suddenly decided at this late date to share even this much of the truth is equally plain. A new scripted cinema film was in the offing, entitled simply <em>A<strong>lie</strong>n</em><em> Autopsy</em>, telling a heavily fictionalized, comedic version of his story. There was now more money to be made from the truth than from the lie, in other words.</p>
<p>Since then, the forgery that made Santilli rich has well and truly passed into history as a classic piece of 1990s kitsch. <em>Der Spiegel</em> was correct; the alien-autopsy film did indeed become the 1990s&#8217; closest equivalent to the Hitler diaries, complete with the same &#8220;what the hell was everyone thinking?&#8221; quality when looked back upon from the perspective of posterity. Unlike the two main perpetrators of that fraud, both of whom did time in West German prisons, Ray Santilli and his partners have never suffered any legal or financial consequences for their actions. For all that far worse criminals have gone equally unpunished, one still can&#8217;t help but feel that there is some injustice in this. The fact is, however, that Rupert Murdoch&#8217;s operation had no reason to pursue the matter. They had gotten many times their purchase price out of the film, whose authenticity had never been of any real concern to them. Only the rubes were duped. Ah, well&#8230; at least <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0466664">the 2006 cinema film</a> was a flop. Its subject matter felt as outmoded by then as grunge music and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEhpmuXHmRQ">Britpop</a>.</p>
<p>Today only the most committed of UFO evangelists still believe in the original alien-autopsy film. Getting the burden of proof hopelessly muddled, these folks now demand that Santilli substantiate not his old claim that the film is genuine but his new one that he faked it. Naturally, his ongoing failure to do so demonstrates that he must have been intimidated by shadowy government agents into concocting the bogus tale of forgery. There&#8217;s something touching about people who want to believe so very, very badly, people for whom aliens have become a sort of religion.</p>
<p>To the jaded eyes of the rest of us, on the other hand, the conspiracy theories of the 1990s now seem charmingly quaint. We might even be tempted to see them as proof of an axiom that, when we humans lack sufficient stuff to worry about, we invent worries to fill that space. In a time when North America and Western Europe were at peace, were as wealthy as they had ever been, and seemed to have definitively demonstrated that liberal democracy and free markets were political perfection achieved &#8212; <a href="/2018/03/the-game-of-everything-part-3-civilization-and-the-narrative-of-progress">&#8220;the end of history,&#8221;</a> as Francis Fukuyama so infamously put it &#8212; what else was there to satisfy their citizens&#8217; need to worry than alien abductions, alien technologies, and a myriad of equally improbable government conspiracies surrounding it all? Then, as soon as September 11, 2001, showed that history just keeps marching on and that we actually had had something substantive to worry about during the previous decade, if only we had recognized it, all of that stuff blew away like tinfoil hats in the wind.</p>
<p>For all that this point of view is inevitably oversimplified, I do feel like there&#8217;s a kernel of truth there. More unnerving, however, is the structural pattern of 1990s conspiracy theories, a pattern which has proved more enduring than their content. Like the tabloid-news outlets which did so much to feed them, they blurred the lines between entertainment and information. People believed them mostly, it seems to me, not so much because they needed something to worry about as because they were <em>fun</em>. It was fun to speculate about what the next layer of the onion might be, fun to feel oneself to be privy to so many secrets and lies. For many people, it was fun as well to have a longstanding suspicion that &#8220;the system&#8221; had always been out to get them confirmed. Despite all their nefarious deeds and actors, conspiracy theories, then as now, were a sort of comfort food, keeping the truly difficult questions in life and politics, which don&#8217;t tend to have such bright neon lines separating good from evil, firmly at bay.</p>
<p>When all was said and done, did their adherents during the 1990s <em>really</em> believe aliens were everywhere? From the outside, it was hard to say for any given individual &#8212; and maybe from the inside as well. Following the tales about Roswell and crop circles and human abductions and all the rest became a form of fandom, not that far removed from the fannish dissection of each new episode of, say, <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0098936"><em>Twin Peaks</em></a> &#8212; or of <em>The X-Files</em>.</p>
<p>Yes, we have finally arrived at the real elephant in this particular room. While the alien-autopsy film was only a blip on the pop-culture radar, grist for the mill of <em>Jeopardy!</em> and <em>Trivial Pursuit</em> in the decades that followed, <em>The X-Files</em>, which likewise aired on Rupert Murdoch&#8217;s young Fox television network, became a veritable way of life for its most committed fans. Its first episode was broadcast in September of 1993, two years before the alien-autopsy special. By popularizing the ideas of alien visitations and government conspiracies to conceal their existence &#8212; ideas which it did not invent, but which were largely confined to the cultural fringe prior to its arrival on the scene &#8212; it laid the groundwork for Ray Santilli&#8217;s hoax. Then it continued on for years after that bit of excitement had come and gone, to become not just a footnote to but an enduring icon of 1990s pop culture, guaranteed to appear on any top-ten list of the decade&#8217;s biggest hits.</p>
<p>&#8220;<em>The X-Files</em> is that rare show that seems to exist both in the time it aired and in the present,&#8221; notes Emily St. James, the coauthor of a recent book about the series. &#8220;It is, beyond all reason, timeless, despite being perhaps <em>the</em> ultimate TV show of the 1990s.&#8221; <em>The X-Files</em> changed the nature of television, the nature of popular entertainment writ large &#8212; and, for good or for ill, it also changed <em>us</em>, as people and as a people. A poll conducted by <em>Time</em> magazine and the news channel CNN in 1997 found that 64 percent of Americans believed that aliens were in the habit of visiting Earth. Absent <em>The X-Files</em>, the number would surely have been a small fraction of that size.</p>
<p>The story of <em>The X-Files</em> as a cultural phenomenon is something of a postmodern Gordian knot. The show borrowed much of its central mythology from fringe conspiracy theories. Then it went on to popularize such theories to such an extent that they could be introduced into the mainstream real-world discourse via organs like Ray Santilli&#8217;s film. And then, the show&#8217;s ongoing fiction began responding to the very same real-world currents which it itself had set in motion.</p>
<p>On November 24, 1995, just three months after the alien-autopsy special, Fox aired the <em>X-Files</em> episode <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0751166">&#8220;Nisei.&#8221;</a> In it, FBI Agent Fox Mulder, the more credulous by far of the show&#8217;s two protagonists, has purchased an alien-autopsy film via mail order, prompting his more skeptical partner Dana Scully to complain that it is &#8220;even hokier than the one that aired on the Fox network.&#8221;  (Her skepticism is ill-founded: in the universe of the show, the footage is real.) To provide the final dollop of irony, the real-world Fox network ran commercials for yet another repeat showing of the alien-autopsy special during the episode in question. The world had never seen a feedback loop quite like this before. It was an early example of a weird hyper-reality that has since become commonplace, such that mediated experiences of all descriptions have become more subjectively real to many of us than the objectively real people and places around us.</p>

The biggest single exhibit in the place is a diorama which proudly depicts the scene in Santilli&#8217;s film, despite the fact that the latter has been so widely dismissed even by most ufologists. Is the museum meant to get at the truth of what happened in Roswell in 1947, or is it really about reveling in all the fantasies that have been spun from what was almost certainly <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Mogul">a fallen espionage balloon</a>? One senses that even the proprietors of the museum aren&#8217;t quite sure anymore. One thing only is crystal clear: that the museum and the town of Roswell make a lot of money from being the UFO capital of the world.</p></div>
<p>Next time, then, we will delve into the origin story of this other 1990s media artifact, whose influence was so pervasive throughout the decade &#8212; including in computer games, my usual beat around here. Take heart, for I can tell you that the truth is <em>sometimes</em> out there: this origin story will actually be true. Would I lie to you?</p>

<p>If someone were to ask you at the beginning of 1998 which studio was most likely to release a little-sung adventure game that year that would go on to become a well-loved cult classic, you probably wouldn&#8217;t think of the little Pennsylvania outfit known as DreamForge Intertainment. For DreamForge&#8217;s track record with the adventure genre &#8212; or with any other genre, for that matter &#8212; was the opposite of imposing.</p>
<p>The studio was founded in 1990 under the name of Event Horizon Software. The people behind it were Jim Namestka, Tom Holmes, and Chris Straka, a trio of programmers recently employed by Paragon Software, a company best known for Marvel Superheroes action games and for <a href="http://crpgaddict.blogspot.com/2015/01/megatraveller-won-with-final-rating.html">conceptually ambitious but functionally half-baked CRPGs</a>, most of which were based on the tabletop properties of Game Designers&#8217; Workshop. After leaving Paragon in a huff over what they described as profound disagreements with the &#8220;creative direction&#8221; being taken there, Namestka, Holmes, and Straka proceeded to specialize in&#8230; yet more <a href="http://crpgaddict.blogspot.com/2013/10/darkspyre-won-with-final-rating.html">conceptually ambitious but functionally half-baked CRPGs</a>, at first without the benefit of a license. In 1993, they remedied the latter problem at least by signing on with SSI to make <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> computer games. The same year, they changed the name of their company. &#8220;We used the word &#8216;dream&#8217; because that&#8217;s what we make, &#8216;forge&#8217; because it implies craftsmanship, and &#8216;Intertainment&#8217; with an &#8216;I&#8217; because it represents the next big thing &#8212; interactive entertainment,&#8221; said Namestka just after the switch. More important than all that, however, the name change avoided confusion with a pornography purveyor that was also called Event Horizon.</p>
<p>DreamForge&#8217;s first <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> game is their best remembered today (not that this is a particularly high bar to meet). Three years before <a href="/2023/07/diablo"><em>Diablo</em></a>, <a href="https://crpgaddict.blogspot.com/2024/05/dungeon-hack-summary-and-rating.html"><em>Dungeon Hack</em></a> tried to deliver an infinitely replayable hack-and-slash CRPG through the magic of procedurally generated dungeons that were new each time out. While it cannot be compared to the dangerously addictive <em>Diablo</em> in any sense but its core concept, some found it a lot of fun at the time.</p>
<p>In these <a href="/2019/09/opening-the-gold-box-part-6-a-troubled-marriage">latter days</a> of <a href="/2016/03/opening-the-gold-box-part-3-from-tabletop-to-desktop">the <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons </em>license</a>, SSI&#8217;s focus had shifted from quality to quantity. DreamForge was, for better or for worse, a good fit for that ethic. Thus they followed up <em>Dungeon Hack</em> with three more <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> action-RPGs in remarkably short order. As a 1994 profile in <em>Computer Gaming World</em> magazine put it, DreamForge saw their principal competitive advantage as the way &#8220;they managed to put out products in a six-month development cycle rather than the more leisurely pace [of] other software houses.&#8221; They certainly weren&#8217;t a studio known for innovation, but, if you just needed a serviceable game that worked off of an established template, and especially if you needed it delivered quickly, they could do that for you as well as just about anyone.</p>
<p>After the <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> license was gone for good, DreamForge continued in this mode for SSI and other publishers, making games like <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/game/6012/war-wind/"><em>War Wind I</em></a> and <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/game/6064/war-wind-ii-human-onslaught/"><em>II</em></a>, some of the very first clones of Blizzard Entertainment&#8217;s ultra-successful <a href="/2023/06/a-dialog-in-real-time-strategy"><em>Warcraft II</em></a> to hit the market. DreamForge was happy to jump on just about any trend. For example, the same year that they made <em>Sanitarium</em>, their aforementioned cult-classic adventure game that will be our main subject for today, they made <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/game/47447/tnn-outdoors-pro-hunter/"><em>TNN Outdoors Pro Hunter</em></a>, which was inspired by <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/game/2922/deer-hunter/"><em>Deer Hunter</em></a>, the schlockiest game ever to sell millions of copies.</p>
<p><em>Sanitarium</em>, however, was different enough to stand out like the proverbial sore thumb in a catalog chock full of workmanlike games made for hire. The only other DreamForge game other than it that might be credibly described as a passion project rather than a business contract fulfilled is, perhaps not coincidentally, also the studio&#8217;s only other point-and-click adventure game. Here I speak of 1996&#8217;s <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/game/245/chronomaster/"><em>Chronomaster</em></a>, a noble effort in its way that sadly turned out a bit of a mess.</p>
<div id="attachment_6082" style="width: 610px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://www.filfre.net/2024/08/sanitarium/10785930-chronomaster-dos-trader/" rel="attachment wp-att-6082"><img decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-6082" class="wp-image-6082" src="https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/10785930-chronomaster-dos-trader-300x225.png" alt="" width="600" height="450" srcset="https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/10785930-chronomaster-dos-trader-300x225.png 300w, https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/10785930-chronomaster-dos-trader.png 640w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-6082" class="wp-caption-text"><em>Chronomaster</em>.</p></div>
<p><em>Chronomaster&#8217;</em>s creative pedigree was undeniably impressive: its audacious central conceit, involving private pocket universes owed by the rich tech-bros of the far future, was just about the last idea ever dreamed up by the science-fiction author <a href="/2014/06/nine-princes-in-amber">Roger Zelazny</a> before his premature death from cancer. Once Zelazny&#8217;s illness had made it impossible for him to continue, the script was finished off by his romantic partner and fellow writer Jane Lindskold. Unfortunately, though, DreamForge didn&#8217;t bother to sweat the details on their end. The game&#8217;s interface is unbelievably convoluted, requiring you to rummage through a menu just to move your character from one point to another on the screen. And the game design is even worse than the interface, being littered with nonsensical puzzles, unclued sudden deaths, and hidden dead ends &#8212; not to mention one of the most irritating mazes ever to appear in a graphic adventure. The protagonist mutters, &#8220;Swell! A maze!&#8221; and then sighs theatrically when you encounter it. DreamForge clearly knew that this would be the player&#8217;s reaction as well. So&#8230; <em>why include it????</em> The mind boggles&#8230;</p>
<p>Passion project or not, nothing about <em>Chronomaster</em> lent much hope for DreamForge&#8217;s return to the adventure genre with <em>Sanitarium</em>. Which is precisely why the latter game is such a pleasant surprise.</p>
<p><em>Sanitarium</em> was, one senses, an indulgence, a reward granted by the small studio&#8217;s founders to their hard-working employees, who had for more than half a decade been cranking out a steady two games per year &#8212; games that might not have been masterpieces, but neither were they, with the arguable exception of <em>Chronomaster</em>, disasters. For once, the folks on the front lines at DreamForge were given a chance to let their imaginations run wild over a blank canvas. Within reason, that is: DreamForge was not a wealthy studio, so the game would have to be finished on a fairly tight budget, within a fairly short amount of time. Cognizant of this, the employees envisioned a very traditionalist point-and-clicker.</p>
<p>A measure of constraint is by no means always a bad thing. In this case, it caused DreamForge to steer clear of the trend toward &#8220;interactive movies&#8221; featuring digitized video clips of real actors. The mixture of pixel art and pre-rendered 3D that they relied upon instead may have seemed dismayingly old-fashioned to some at the time, but today we can say that <em>Sanitarium&#8217;</em>s visuals have aged far better than many a more expensive production of the era. Rather than anything released more recently, LucasArts&#8217;s five-year-old <a href="/2019/06/day-of-the-tentacle"><em>Day of the Tentacle</em></a> became DreamForge&#8217;s model in terms of technology and puzzle design. Definitely not in terms of mood, though: <em>Tentacle</em> was a cartoon comedy, which has always been the low-hanging fruit of the genre, for all that LucasArts was masterful at executing it. <em>Sanitarium</em><em>&#8216;</em>s atmosphere was to be dark and grim, a braver thing to attempt and a trickier one to pull off. The game was to combine classic and contemporary psychological horror, having a list of inspirations that included <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0052520"><em>The Twilight Zone</em></a>, <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0056777"><em>The Outer Limits</em></a>, <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0099871"><em>Jacob&#8217;s Ladder</em></a>, <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0114369"><em>Se7en</em></a>, and <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0114746"><em>12 Monkeys</em></a>.</p>
<p>The core gang of four that coalesced around the game consisted of design lead Mike Nicholson, writer Chris Pasetto, head programmer Chad Freeman, and art director Eric Rice. The team was unusual in that, although almost every single one of its members would enjoy a long later career in mainstream commercial game development, none would ever make another adventure game.</p>
<p>Luckily for us, DreamForge made their second and last time at bat with the genre count. Every problem <em>Chronomaster</em> had has been fixed in <em>Sanitarium</em>. The interface is clean and simple: right click and hold to walk around the screen, right click over your avatar to bring up a radial menu of the objects he&#8217;s carrying, left click to interact with things out in the environment. Then, too, DreamForge embraced LucasArts&#8217;s &#8220;no deaths and no dead ends&#8221; philosophy of design. To this they married a wide variety of puzzles that are not too hard but not too easy either, being balanced nicely to keep you engaged without ever stopping your progress through the plot for too long. If there was an award for most improved maker of adventure games, DreamForge would surely deserve the prize for 1998 on the basis of <em>Sanitarium&#8217;</em>s surface qualities alone.</p>
<p>Having said that, though, I also have to tell you that its surface qualities are not the reason <em>Sanitarium</em> is a game that sticks with you long after you&#8217;ve finished it. It&#8217;s the story and the themes that are really special. As a critic, I hate to use this word, but sometimes it&#8217;s unavoidable: this game has <em>soul</em>.</p>
<p>Mind you, this quality of soulfulness is not exactly front and center from the beginning. Your first glance at the blood and guts that are strewn across its environments may make you think of a hundred other 1990s videogames which love ultra-violence for its own sake. The story too initially seems decidedly unpromising. It does, after all, revolve around amnesia, that most clichéd of all the tools in a fiction writer&#8217;s toolbox.</p>
<p>You play a fellow known only as Max, whom an apparent car accident has recently left in a coma. Instead of a hospital bed, you awaken from your long sleep in the titular sanitarium, a place straight out of a Victorian penny dreadful. Nothing around or on your person is of much help in remembering who you are: you&#8217;re wearing only a set of anonymous nurse&#8217;s scrubs, and your whole head is so swaddled in bandages that you can&#8217;t even see what you look like. Your objective in the game is, naturally, to figure out who you are, how you arrived in this horrible place, and how you can escape your predicament. You pass through a series of dream sequences, over the course of which you slowly begin to piece these things together. (This vignette structure is one of the ways the game keeps a lid on its difficulty, by ensuring that the combinatorial explosion of available puzzles and objects never gets out of hand.) And a surprising thing happens as you venture deeper into the game: what started out as just another exercise in B-movie-style horror and surrealism slowly reveals itself to have much more on its mind and its heart than first appeared to be the case. It addresses some very sensitive topics &#8212; among them child abuse and the death of a child &#8212; with more empathy and compassion than I would ever have dared to expect.</p>
<p><em>Sanitarium</em> does walk a fine line at times between the overwrought and the profound; even when I was halfway through the game, I still wasn&#8217;t entirely sure which side of that line it would ultimately land on. When all is said and done, though, it dodges the worst of the traps it&#8217;s laid for itself by sticking the ending in a way that games like this too seldom do. <em>Sanitarium</em>, you see, goes against the surrealistic tide by pretty thoroughly explaining all of its weirdness. &#8220;I felt very strongly that, having invested so much in the characters, an unresolved ending would feel extremely cheap to the player,&#8221; says Mike Nicholson. You are absolutely correct, Mike; kudos to you for staying the course and delivering an interactive story that&#8217;s fully realized in the Aristotelian sense. The player does get to find out what is really going on, and even gets to enjoy a happy ending.</p>
<p>So, my advice to you, my good readers, is to trust the game even when it seems dubiously worthy of your trust, to give it a chance to reveal its real self at its own speed. If you do so, I think you&#8217;ll find that it repays your patience and willingness to withhold judgment handsomely.</p>

<em>Sanitarium</em> is by no means a AAA game. It was made in just sixteen months, on a sharply limited budget. &#8220;We worked with the time and budget we had,&#8221; says Mike Nicholson. Fair enough; no one can ask for more. That said, its creators&#8217; limited resources do show through: the game&#8217;s graphics are far from the state of the art even for 1998, its voice acting marked by a limited number of actors and by the inherent limitations of some of them &#8212; including the one playing Max himself, whose histrionics are sometimes more than a little bit over the top. Yet, even when setting aside its unusually weighty thematic ambitions, <em>Sanitarium</em> remains a well-crafted, even well-polished game within the set of restrictions that are its lot in life. If it does nothing really new, it does the tried and true very, very well. In that sense, it offered hope back in 1998 for a genre that was increasingly in need of it.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a standard narrative about the history of adventure gaming, which you can read of here and there on this site as well as plenty of other places. It describes how adventures rose to become arguably the hottest of all gaming genres during the first half of the 1990s. And then, with dizzying abruptness, the genre &#8220;died,&#8221; for a whole range of reasons that different chroniclers choose to emphasize to differing degrees: too many games in general, and especially too many with a poor grasp on the fundamentals of good adventure design; a lack of innovative new design ideas; the terrible economics of paying $50 or more for a game that you would be done with after just five to ten hours; an inability to compete with the fast-paced, visceral nature of the latest first-person shooters and real-time strategies; the challenges of distribution in a marketplace where the number of games was growing far faster than the available shelf space at retail, even as online digital distribution was not yet practical for asset-heavy games like these.</p>
<p>All of these reasons are valid when considered in their appropriate context. Nevertheless, the standard narrative masks an important fact. Although adventure games definitely went into a pronounced commercial decline after 1995, definitely became niche rather than mainstream products in gaming&#8217;s new world order, they never actually &#8220;died&#8221; at all. Even in the very worst years for the genre, new adventures were still released. And in the due course of time, the adventure game learned to reckon with its relegation to niche status, found ways to survive and even to be modestly profitable as part of a long tail of games that trucked along behind the razzle-dazzle of <a href="/2023/04/the-next-generation-in-graphics-part-1-three-dimensions-in-software-or-quake-and-its-discontents"><em>Quake</em></a>, <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/game/330/unreal/"><em>Unreal</em></a>, and <a href="/2024/07/starcraft-a-history-in-two-acts"><em>Starcraft</em></a>.</p>
<p>Adventures&#8217; means of living on after their alleged death were varied. Most obviously, they entailed reduced budgets, even though that meant accepting reduced production values, and reduced price points, even though that cut into an already precarious bottom line. More and more in the course of time, they would include moving production out of North America and Western Europe to Asia and Eastern Europe, where artists and programmers were willing and able to work much more cheaply. This new breed of adventure game would not be advertised in the front pages of glossy magazines and featured in flashy end-cap displays inside stores, as their predecessors had been. These adventure games were thrilled if they could just secure a bottom shelf somewhere for themselves; when they couldn&#8217;t, there were always the mail-order and Internet-based storefronts, who, unlike the brick-and-mortar retailers, were in a position to stock any and every game in their warehouses, no matter how niche its appeal.</p>
<p>As a game produced on a modest budget, with correspondingly modest commercial expectations on the part of its developer, <em>Sanitarium</em> can be seen as an early example of these trends, coming along even as the last of the bigger-budget adventure games from the big studios &#8212; titles like <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/game/1174/black-dahlia/"><em>Black Dahlia</em></a>, <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/game/1/the-x-files-game/"><em>The X-Files Game</em></a>, <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/game/201/grim-fandango/"><em>Grim Fandango</em></a>, and <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/game/484/gabriel-knight-3-blood-of-the-sacred-blood-of-the-damned/"><em>Gabriel Knight 3</em></a> &#8212; were still either in the pipeline or fresh on store shelves.</p>
<p>And <em>Sanitarium</em> serves as an early riposte to a lot of the assumptions behind the standard histories of adventure games in yet one more way. I, for one, am not at all convinced that the genre&#8217;s decline in prominence actually led to worse games. When adventures were no longer flagship titles on which the stock prices of their corporate parents depended, there was less pressure to release them before their time. When the people making them were doing so strictly out of love for the genre instead of because they were chasing the trendy flavor of the month, said people were more willing to sweat the details of design. Likewise, when the budget couldn&#8217;t be stretched enough to create an audiovisual spectacle, the only way to stand out was through excellent writing and puzzles. And when the old &#8220;Siliwood&#8221; vision of adventure games as interactive movies populated by real actors was thrown onto the dustbin of history, studios were able to return to older approaches that were often more satisfying than watching reams of grainy green-screened video. So, not only did a year never go by without producing at least a few new adventures, but at least one or two of those adventures were always pretty darn good, just like <em>Sanitarium</em> is. Not bad for a dead genre.</p>
<p>The obvious comparison to make is with the graphic adventure&#8217;s evolutionary forefather, the text adventure, which went through a similar boom and bust about a decade before its progeny. By the early 1990s, the text adventure really was dead as a commercial proposition, deader than the graphic adventure would ever be. And yet the text adventure writ large did not die. Its disappearance from store shelves rather left the field open to impassioned amateurs, who <a href="/2019/11/new-tricks-for-an-old-z-machine-part-3-a-renaissance-is-nigh">programmed tools for making them</a> that were more sophisticated than anything any of the commercial houses could ever lay claim to. Then, being freed by the absence of economic pressure to focus on design, writing, and innovation, the amateurs used these tools to create <a href="/2021/09/the-neo-classical-interactive-fiction-of-1995">games that were not just as good as but in many ways better than the best of the 1980s</a>. The major difference in the case of graphic adventures was that the latter <em>were</em> able to maintain a low-key commercial presence, even as open-source authoring systems like Adventure Game Studio would eventually allow amateurs to create remarkably sophisticated games of this style as well. The beginning of that scene is still a few years removed from the point at which we now stand in these histories, but I do look forward to covering it alongside the professional graphic adventures &#8212; and the amateur text adventures, of course &#8212; in the future.</p>
<p>In the meantime, though, there is <em>Sanitarium</em>, the advance guard that pointed the way to where the genre as a whole would have to go within the next couple of years. To have a future, adventure games would have to reconnect with their past, pretending the Siliwood craze had never happened and refocusing on the fundamentals. This is exactly what <em>Sanitarium</em> does, to fine effect.</p>

The rest of the story of <em>Sanitarium</em> and DreamForge Intertainment is far briefer than that of the adventure game in general. Instead of DreamForge&#8217;s usual partner SSI, <em>Sanitarium</em> was published by the relatively brief-lived American Softworks Corporation, something of a dumping ground for second-tier games like this one that didn&#8217;t much interest the glitzier publishers. Needless to say, <em>Sanitarium</em> wasn&#8217;t a big seller.<span class="footnote_referrer"><a role="button" tabindex="0" onclick="footnote_moveToReference_6050_20('footnote_plugin_reference_6050_20_1');" onkeypress="footnote_moveToReference_6050_20('footnote_plugin_reference_6050_20_1');" ><sup id="footnote_plugin_tooltip_6050_20_1" class="footnote_plugin_tooltip_text">[1]</sup></a><span id="footnote_plugin_tooltip_text_6050_20_1" class="footnote_tooltip">Gazing back through the rose-tinted glasses of memory, Mike Nicholson guesses that <em>Sanitarium</em> sold around 300,000 copies. Based on my knowledge of the industry and the game&#8217;s public profile, I suspect that this figure is inflated by a factor of two to five. If it were correct, <em>Sanitarium</em> would stand as the best-selling game DreamForge ever made by a huge margin, raising the question of why they didn&#8217;t immediately invest in another adventure.</span></span><script type="text/javascript"> jQuery('#footnote_plugin_tooltip_6050_20_1').tooltip({ tip: '#footnote_plugin_tooltip_text_6050_20_1', tipClass: 'footnote_tooltip', effect: 'fade', predelay: 0, fadeInSpeed: 200, delay: 400, fadeOutSpeed: 200, position: 'bottom center', relative: true, offset: [-7, 100], });</script> For all that much of the form and spirit of the post-millennial adventure game can be seen here in a nascent form, it would take cleverer publishers than ASC to figure out how to sell the games consistently at a (modest) profit &#8212; another story for another time.</p>
<p>As it was, this weirdly aberrant game in the DreamForge catalog justified that description by becoming the last of its kind from them. In fact, the studio finished only one more game of any type after <em>Sanitarium</em> and <em>TNN Outdoors Pro Hunter</em>, their odd couple of 1998: that game being the more typically workmanlike <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/game/2312/warhammer-40000-rites-of-war/"><em>Warhammer 40,000: Rites of War</em></a> of 1999. With DreamForge&#8217;s traditional business model of making derivative games that were just good enough becoming harder and harder to sustain in the changing industry, the company was dissolved not long after.</p>
<p><em>Sanitarium</em> stands today as their one real moment of glory, their one game that truly deserves to be discovered and appreciated by a new generation of gamers. Thankfully, its presence on modern digital storefronts allows this. Personally, I rank it alongside <a href="/2024/06/the-journeyman-project"><em>Journeyman Project 3</em></a> and <a href="/2024/08/tex-murphy-and-the-coming-of-the-dvd-a-shaggy-dog-story"><em>Tex Murphy: Overseer</em></a> as one of my three favorite graphic adventures of 1998. While the former two titles both represent the end of an era of adventure gaming, <em>Sanitarium</em> is the dawning glow of a new one. I submit it to you as Exhibit Number One for my case that the adventure game&#8217;s life after death will be in its own way every bit as exciting as its lusty youth.</p>
